 Development of [isoproterenol]-induced cardiac hypertrophy. The development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of [isoproterenol] (ISO) (0.3 mg/kg body weight). The development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female Wistar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of [isoproterenol] ([ISO]) (0.3 mg/kg body weight). However, dP/dt in the [ISO]-treated hearts was slightly but significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated. These data indicate that the adaptive response to [ISO] shows an early hypertrophic phase (1-4 days) characterized by a substantial increase in RNA content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in DNA. However, prolonged stimulation (8-12 days) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular hypertrophy and [hyperplasia] within the heart.

 Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, [rigidity] was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the [alfentanil]-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Rats that received ketanserin and [alfentanil] exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone. These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that [muscle rigidity], a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways. Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced [rigidity], although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.

 Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal CO2, intravenous administration of [fentanyl] (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles. Such an induced [muscular rigidity] by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. Microinjection of [fentanyl] (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation.

 METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of [paracetamol]-induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. We compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an [acute liver failure] and those in whom it did not. These observations speak against long-term effects of [acute liver failure]. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of [acute liver failure].

 This is important, since different controlled release formulations of [bupropion] release the active drug at different rates. A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to [bupropion HCl] 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group). [Bupropion HCl] was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the [convulsions] or absence of [convulsions] were recorded. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the [[convulsions]] or absence of [[convulsions]] were recorded. Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of [convulsions] to 99.8% reduction at 240 min.

 Analysis of protein expression using antibody microarrays and Western blotting revealed differential changes in MAP kinase-related pathways after multiple and single [METH] injections. There were statistically significant (p<0.05) decreases in MEK1, Erk2p, GSK3alpha, 14-3-3e, and MEK7 in the striata of mice after multiple injections of [METH]. MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of [METH], but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of [METH]. MEK1 was significantly decreased also after a single injection of [[METH]], but to a much lesser degree than after multiple injections of [[METH]]. In the frontal cortex, there was a statistically significant decrease in GSK3alpha after multiple (but not single) injections of [METH]. These findings suggest that alterations in MAP kinase-related pathways in the prefronto-striatal circuitries might be involved in the manifestation of [aggressive behaviors] in mice.

 Therapeutic drug monitoring of [tobramycin]: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of [tobramicyn] on steady-state serum concentrations and toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. [tobramycin] (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups. Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of [tobramycin] and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. [Tobramycin] serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. In TD group, three patients developed [decreased auditory function], of which one presented with an auditory loss of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented [decreased auditory function]. In TD group, three patients developed [decreased auditory function], of which one presented with an [auditory loss] of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented [decreased auditory function]. In TD group, three patients developed [[decreased auditory function]], of which one presented with an [auditory loss] of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented [[decreased auditory function]].

 This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM-5887 on low-grade cardiotoxicity pre-induced by [doxorubicin] in beagle dogs. In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of [doxorubicin] (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg). Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either [doxorubicin] (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. The low-grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional [doxorubicin] treatment. On the contrary, the SM-5887 treatment did not progress the grade of [cardiomyopathy]. In conclusion, SM-5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on [doxorubicin]-induced cardiotoxicity in dogs.

Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of [fasciculation] were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered. The results indicate that [muscle fasciculation] was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of [muscle fasciculation] than those in Group PS (p < 0.001). The results indicate that [[muscle fasciculation]] was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of [[muscle fasciculation]] than those in Group PS (p < 0.001).

 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), including [akathisia], with quetiapine in patients with bipolar mania. Two studies evaluated quetiapine monotherapy (up to 800 mg/day) (n = 209) versus placebo (n = 198), with lithium or [haloperidol] monotherapy as respective active controls. RESULTS: The incidence of EPS-related adverse events, including [akathisia], was no different with quetiapine monotherapy (12.9%) than with placebo (13.1%). Adverse events related to EPS occurred in 59.6% of patients treated with [haloperidol] (n = 99) monotherapy, whereas 26.5% of patients treated with lithium (n = 98) monotherapy experienced adverse events related to EPS. The incidence of [akathisia] was low and similar with quetiapine monotherapy (3.3%) and placebo (6.1%), and with QTP + Li/DVP (3.6%) and PBO + Li/DVP (4.9%). CONCLUSIONS: In bipolar mania, the incidence of EPS, including [akathisia], with quetiapine therapy is similar to that with placebo.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify specific clinical predictors of [reduction in renal function] in patients with CHF who are prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. [Decreased renal function] was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, [diuretic], and beta-blocker therapy. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of [decreased renal function] than controls (P =.003). Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing [decreased renal function] in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). A lower risk of [renal impairment] was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (RR 0.93 per 5% increment, 95% CI 0.91-0. 96). CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril use caused a 33% increase in the risk of [decreased renal function] in patients with CHF. [Diuretic] use and advanced age increased this risk. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of [renal impairment] in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group.

Whereas 33.3% of the patients with [CIN] were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of [CIN] related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014). Whereas 33.3% of the patients with [[CIN]] were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of [[CIN]] related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014). Among the 15 patients with [CIN], 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243). Although clinically silent, [CIN] is not rare in pediatrics. The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although [CIN] usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.

 [Ethambutol] is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis. However, early on, when the toxic [optic neuropathy] is mild and partly reversible, the funduscopic findings are often subtle and easy to miss. This is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parvo-cellular axons (or small-caliber axons) within the papillo-macular bundle in toxic or hereditary [optic neuropathies]. OCT can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of [optic neuropathies].

 Optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with [ethambutol]-induced optic neuropathy. PURPOSE: To map and identify the pattern, in vivo, of axonal degeneration in [ethambutol]-induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography (OCT). [Ethambutol] is an antimycobacterial agent often used to treat tuberculosis. A serious complication of [ethambutol] is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. In both sets (four) of eyes of the subjects with persistent [visual deficits] (patients B and C), there was an average loss of 79% of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadrant. CONCLUSIONS: The OCT results in these patients with [EMB]-induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fibers. Additionally, in terms of management of [EMB]-induced optic neuropathy, it is important to properly manage ethambutol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached.

 Effects of the cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor valdecoxib versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular [thrombotic] events in patients with arthritis. There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular [thrombotic] events may be higher with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The incidence of cardiovascular [thrombotic] events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial [thrombotic]) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, or naproxen 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration. The incidence of cardiovascular [[thrombotic]] events (cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular, or arterial [[thrombotic]]) was determined by analyzing pooled valdecoxib (10-80 mg daily), nonselective NSAID (diclofenac 75 mg bid, ibuprofen 800 mg tid, or naproxen 500 mg bid) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6-52 weeks in duration. The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7934) and in users of low-dose (< or =325 mg daily) [aspirin] (n = 1051) and nonusers of [aspirin] (n = 6883). The incidence rates of events were determined in all patients (n = 7934) and in users of low-dose (< or =325 mg daily) [[aspirin]] (n = 1051) and nonusers of [[aspirin]] (n = 6883). Crude and exposure-adjusted incidences of [thrombotic] events were similar for valdecoxib, NSAIDs, and placebo. The risk of serious [thrombotic] events was also similar for each valdecoxib dose. The rates of events in users of [aspirin] were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across valdecoxib doses. Short- and intermediate-term treatment with therapeutic (10 or 20 mg daily) and supratherapeutic (40 or 80 mg daily) valdecoxib doses was not associated with an increased incidence of [thrombotic] events relative to nonselective NSAIDs or placebo in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in controlled clinical trials.

 BACKGROUND: [Hypotension] and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) [NTG] immediately after learning, 3) [NTG] 3 h after learning, 4) [NTG] and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) [[NTG]] immediately after learning, 3) [[NTG]] 3 h after learning, 4) [[NTG]] and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone.

The extent of [hypotension] and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals. In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of [NTG] (n = 3) and [NTG] + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of [[NTG]] (n = 3) and [[NTG]] + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the [NTG] group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the [NTG] + NIMO groups, respectively. PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the [[NTG]] group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the [[NTG]] + NIMO groups, respectively. The observed effect of NIMO may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during [hypotension], because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups.

 A catch in the [Reye]. Twenty-six cases of [Reye syndrome] from The Children's Hospital, Camperdown, Australia, occurring between 1973 and 1982 were reviewed. Of these, 20 cases met the US Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control criteria for the diagnosis of [Reye syndrome]. [Aspirin] or salicylate ingestion had occurred in only one of the 20 cases (5%), and paracetamol (acetaminophen) had been administered in only six of the cases (30%). Pathologic confirmation of the diagnosis of [Reye syndrome] was accomplished in 90% of the cases. The incidence of [Reye syndrome] in New South Wales, Australia, is estimated from this study to be approximately nine cases per 1 million children compared with recent US data of ten to 20 cases per 1 million children and three to seven cases per 1 million children in Great Britain. The mortality for these [Reye syndrome] cases in Australia was 45% as compared with a 32% case-fatality rate in the United States.

 Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department [seizure] patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department [seizure] patients. METHODS: This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible [seizure] patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation. Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite [benzoylecgonine] using enzyme-mediated immunoassay methodology. Plasma samples with [benzoylecgonine] greater than 150 ng/mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng/mL were defined as positive. Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol-related [seizure] disorder, estimated time from [seizure] to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol-related [[seizure]] disorder, estimated time from [[seizure]] to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. RESULTS: Fourteen of 248 (5.6%, 95% CI 2.7%-8.5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for [benzoylecgonine] and no samples (0%, 95% CI 0-1.2%) were positive for amphetamine. CONCLUSIONS: During this study period, routine plasma screening for cocaine and amphetamines in adult [seizure] patients had a low yield.

 Pain responses in [methadone]-maintained opioid abusers. This study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in [methadone]-maintenance (MM) treatment (n = 60) in comparison to matched nondependent control subjects (n = 60). These data indicate that MM opioid abusers represent a [pain-intolerant] subset of clinical patients.

 RESULTS: Following intravenous [PAN] urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four. Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak [proteinuria] and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets (day six onwards).

 Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen-induced rat [pituitary tumors] may mediate estrogen-initiated tumor angiogenesis. The results demonstrated that [17beta-estradiol] (E2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The results demonstrated that [17beta-estradiol] ([E2]) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the [E2] exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. After 15 days of [E2] exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of [E2] exposure.

 We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of netilmicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with [piperacillin sodium] in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infections. Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and [piperacillin]-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and [piperacillin]-treated patients. Of those evaluated with posttherapy audiograms, three of four netilmicin and [[piperacillin]]-treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and [[piperacillin]]-treated patients. The number of greater than or equal to 15-dB increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15-dB changes (increases and decreases) was significantly lower in netilmicin and [piperacillin]- vs tobramycin and [piperacillin]-treated patients (18 of 78 vs 67 of 115).

 Delayed asystolic cardiac arrest after [diltiazem] overdose; resuscitation with high dose intravenous calcium.

The patient remained unresponsive with junctional [bradycardia], unrecordable blood pressure, and then became asystolic. This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe [diltiazem] overdose, particularly with the onset of asystole.

 The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and [ribavirin]. Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting [hemolytic anemia]. Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of [ribavirin]-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. Although [ribavirin]-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage [ribavirin]-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages.

 OBJECTIVES: Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha-2b/[ribavirin] compared with interferon-alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of [RIHA] during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of [RIHA]. Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating [RIHA]. RESULTS: [RIHA], defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g/L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy. We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant [RIHA] to be  170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range  68- 692). CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant [RIHA] is 1% ( 170/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs. Despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating [RIHA] provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect.

Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating [RIHA]. RESULTS: [RIHA], defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g/L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy. The standard of care for management of [RIHA] is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage. We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant [RIHA] to be  170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range  68- 692). CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant [RIHA] is 1% ( 170/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs.

The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine-induced [catatonia] in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of [catatonia] (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. Serotonin and N-acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas [melatonin] potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. Ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent; furthermore, [melatonin] did not augment the ketamine DOC whereas dopamine continued to do so. In addition, these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine DOC induced by [melatonin]. Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine [catatonia] rather than directly on the pituitary.

 In normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cystometry, intravesically instilled [prostaglandin (PG) E2] facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pressure. Intra-arterially given [PGE2] produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex, indicating that the PG had a direct contractant effect on the detrusor smooth muscle. The effect of intra-arterial [PGE2] could not be blocked by intra-arterial RP 67,580 or SR 48,968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial [PGE2] was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically. The effect of intra-arterial [[PGE2]] could not be blocked by intra-arterial RP 67,580 or SR 48,968, which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial [[PGE2]] was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically. The present results thus suggest that intra-arterial [PGE2], given near the bladder, may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detrusor. However, when given intravesically, [PGE2] may stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and/or immediately below the urothelium. Prostanoids may, via release of tachykinins, contribute to both urge and [bladder hyperactivity] seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract.

It discusses demographics, clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia, postulated mechanisms of [SIAT], and different treatment possibilities such as medications, surgery, and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like [salbutamol] (known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as atenolol (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.

The prevalence of [postoperative delirium] was significantly lower in the light sedation group (11/57 [19%] vs 23/57 [40%] in the deep sedation group; P=.02), indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4.7 patients treated with light sedation. Limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple, safe, and cost-effective intervention for preventing [postoperative delirium] in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted.

Cessation of [[sorafenib]] and administration of Ca-channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms, but relapse occurred after resumption of [[sorafenib]]. [Sorafenib] is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival. On the other hand, the Rho/ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of [coronary artery spasm]. Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho/ROCK pathway by [sorafenib] use.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component [zidovudine] ([3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine]; [[AZT]]) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of [[AZT]] (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml). In contrast, [AZT]-treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in HIV-positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to HAART-induced [cardiomyopathy] due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction.

 Excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of [seizures] at the cellular level.

We compared these results with those previously obtained with [kainic acid] (KA), a potent glutamate agonist. We compared these results with those previously obtained with [kainic acid] ([KA]), a potent glutamate agonist. Importantly, D2R -/- mice develop [seizures] at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity. Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for [seizures] induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine.

 Effects of [cisapride] on symptoms and postcibal small-bowel motor function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of [abdominal pain] and discomfort and may be related to disordered gastrointestinal motility. Our aim was to assess the effects of long-term treatment with a prokinetic agent, [cisapride], on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBS (constipation-predominant, n = 17; diarrhoea-predominant, n = 21) underwent 24-h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week's treatment [[cisapride], 5 mg three times daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19)]. RESULTS: In diarrhoea-predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the [cisapride] and placebo groups. In [cisapride]-treated diarrhoea-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, [cisapride] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, [cisapride] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, [cisapride] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo. In [[cisapride]]-treated diarrhoea-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, [[cisapride]] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, [[cisapride]] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, [[cisapride]] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo.

In [[[[cisapride]]]]-treated diarrhoea-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, [[[[cisapride]]]] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, [[[[cisapride]]]] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, [[[[cisapride]]]] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo. Symptom scores relating to the severity of constipation were lower in [cisapride]-treated constipation-predominant IBS patients [score, 54 +/- 5 versus 67 +/- 14 mm, [cisapride] versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 62 +/- 19 mm].

BACKGROUND: [Unfractionated heparin sodium] ([UFH]) or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation. We started LMWH (25 IU/kg/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to [UFH] (5000 U/d) on POD 2 or 3. The dose of [UFH] was changed according to the activated clotting time level. [HIT] antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14. Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were [HIT] antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable. The [heparin]-induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients. The percentage of [HIT] antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14.

The combination of a relatively high dose of [clarithromycin] in face of chronic renal failure in a functionally anephric patient, with underlying aluminum intoxication, may have facilitated the appearance of this neurotoxic side effect.

 Acute renal toxicity of [doxorubicin] (adriamycin)-loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Acute renal toxicity of [doxorubicin] ([adriamycin])-loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Acute [doxorubicin]-loaded nanoparticle (DXNP) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis. In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free [doxorubicin] (DX) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived. In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free [doxorubicin] ([DX]) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or [DX]NP survived. Free NP did not provoke any [proteinuria]. Two hr post-injection, [DX]NP was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free [DX] (p < 0.025). In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis, 5/6 rats given [DX] died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by [DX]NP, NP, or untreated, which all survived. These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, [DX]NP killed less animals than free [DX], despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former.

 Various data suggest that male patients who have received [digoxin] on a longterm basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone (LH). This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of [digoxin] therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of [digoxin] on plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and LH. This study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long-term administration of [[digoxin]] therapy and sexual behavior, and the effect of [[digoxin]] on plasma levels of estradiol, testosterone, and LH. The patients of the study and control group (without [digoxin]) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age (25-40 years) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patients. The findings support the reports concerning [digoxin] effect on plasma estradiol, testosterone, and LH. Tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant [decrease in sexual desire], sexual excitement phase (erection), and frequency of sexual relations in the study group.

 Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-[nephrotic] stage (day 1-5) and [nephrotic] stage (day 6-11). Since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment, the time-course study was divided into two stages: pre-[[nephrotic]] stage (day 1-5) and [[nephrotic]] stage (day 6-11). In pre-[nephrotic] stage the plasma level of fatty acids, triacylglycerol and VLDL decreased while that of phospholipid, cholesteryl esters and HDL remained constant. At the beginning of [nephrotic] stage (day 6) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level, while that of apolipoprotein A-I increased abruptly (4-fold increase) and continued to rise, although less steeply, in the following days. In the pre-[nephrotic] stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early [nephrotic] stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL. In the pre-[[nephrotic]] stage lipoproteinuria was negligible, while in the early [[nephrotic]] stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of HDL. These observations indicate that [puromycin aminonucleoside] alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering VLDL and increasing HDL. It is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma HDL found in [nephrotic] rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on HDL metabolism.

 Thyroid function and urine-concentrating ability during [lithium] treatment. We measured serum thyroxine and urine-concentrating ability (Umax) in response to desmopressin (DDAVP) in 85 patients receiving [lithium]. Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and [hypothyroid] patients while some [hypothyroid] patients concentrated their urine well. Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and [[hypothyroid]] patients while some [[hypothyroid]] patients concentrated their urine well. It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which [lithium] exerts these two effects are different.

 1. Studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic [prazosin] treatment alters the alpha 2-adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Conscious SHR (male 300-350 g) were subjected to 90 degrees head-up tilts for 60 s following acute administration of [prazosin] (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) or rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.). [Orthostatic hypotension] was determined by the average decrease (%) in mean arterial pressure (MAP femoral) over the 60-s tilt period. The basal MAP of conscious SHR was reduced to a similar extent by [prazosin] (-23%(-)-26% MAP) and rauwolscine (-16%(-)-33% MAP). 3. Conscious SHR were treated for 4 days with [prazosin] at 2 mg kg-1 day-1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockade. MAP in conscious SHR after chronic [prazosin] treatment was 14% lower than in the untreated SHR (n = 8). Conversely, administration of rauwolscine (3 mg kg-1 i.v.) in chronic [prazosin] treated SHR decreased the basal MAP by 12-31% (n = 4), and subsequent tilts induced further drops of MAP by 19-23% in these rats. The pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1-agonist cirazoline (0.6 and 2 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), the alpha 2-agonist Abbott-53693 (1 and 3 micrograms kg-1 i.v.), and noradrenaline (0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg-1 i.v.) were determined in conscious SHR with and without chronic [prazosin] pretreatment. Both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cirazoline were abolished in chronic [prazosin] treated SHR (n = 4) as compared to the untreated SHR (n = 4). On the other hand, the pressor effects of Abbott-53693 were similar in both groups of SHR, but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in SHR with chronic [prazosin] treatment than without such treatment. Furthermore, the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline-induced pressor effect in SHR was similar with and without chronic [prazosin] treatment despite a 47-71% reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1-receptor blocked SHR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

 [22-oxacalcitriol] suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal failure. BACKGROUND: Calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks, including [hypercalcemia] and/or marked suppression of bone turnover, which may lead to adynamic bone disease. A new vitamin D analogue, [22-oxacalcitriol] (OCT), has been shown to have promising characteristics. A new vitamin D analogue, [22-oxacalcitriol] ([OCT]), has been shown to have promising characteristics. This study was undertaken to determine the effects of [OCT] on serum PTH levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function. Fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation, half of the Nx and Sham dogs received doses of [OCT] (three times per week); the other half were given vehicle for 60 weeks. Biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study, and bone biopsies were done at baseline, 60 weeks after [OCT] or vehicle treatment, and at the end of the crossover period. RESULTS: In Nx dogs, [OCT] significantly decreased serum PTH levels soon after the induction of renal insufficiency. In long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, [OCT] (0.03 microg/kg) stabilized serum PTH levels during the first months. These effects were accompanied by episodes of [hypercalcemia] and hyperphosphatemia. In animals with normal renal function, [OCT] induced a transient decrease in serum PTH levels at a dose of 0.1 microg/kg, which was not sustained with lowering of the doses. In Nx dogs, [OCT] reversed abnormal bone formation, such as woven osteoid and fibrosis, but did not significantly alter the level of bone turnover. In addition, [OCT] improved mineralization lag time, (that is, the rate at which osteoid mineralizes) in both Nx and Sham dogs.

CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that even though [OCT] does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency, it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and, therefore, does not increase the risk of adynamic bone disease.

 Long-term efficacy and toxicity of high-dose [amiodarone] therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. [Amiodarone] was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 118) or a cardiac arrest (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with [amiodarone] and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing [amiodarone] at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug.

 Effect of calcium chloride and 4-aminopyridine therapy on [desipramine] toxicity in rats. BACKGROUND: [Hypotension] is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant overdose. This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced [hypotension]. In a second experiment, rats received tricyclic antidepressant [desipramine] IP followed in 15 min by 4-aminopyridine or saline. RESULTS: NaHCO3 briefly (5 min) reversed [hypotension] and QRS prolongation. CONCLUSION: The administration of CaCl2 or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced [hypotension] in rats. These findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced [hypotension].

 Phase I trial of [13-cis-retinoic acid] in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation. PURPOSE: Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with [13-cis-retinoic acid] (cis-RA) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation. PURPOSE: Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with [13-cis-retinoic acid] ([cis-RA]) can cause sustained inhibition of proliferation. Since [cis-RA] has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients, it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therapy. This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximal-tolerated dosage (MTD), toxicities, and pharmacokinetics of [cis-RA] administered on an intermittent schedule in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one assessable patients, 2 to 12 years of age, were treated with oral [cis-RA] administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 courses. RESULTS: The MTD of [cis-RA] was 160 mg/m2/d. Dose-limiting toxicities in six of nine patients at 200 mg/m2/d included hypercalcemia (n = 3), rash (n = 2), and anemia/[thrombocytopenia]/emesis/rash (n = 1). All toxicities resolved after [cis-RA] was discontinued. The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol/L. CONCLUSION: The MTD of [cis-RA] given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg/m2/d. The DLT included hypercalcemia, and may be predicted by serum [cis-RA] levels. Monitoring of serum calcium and [cis-RA] levels is indicated in future trials.

 Dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate-induced [narcosis] in rats. Melatonin affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced [narcosis]. [Sodium thiopenthal] was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre-treated with melatonin (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg). Melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate [narcosis], however, no dose-effect correlation was found. In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate [narcosis]. In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of [narcosis], and a reduction in mortality rate. Melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or diazepam-induced [narcosis]. Thus, the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological [narcosis] seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action.

 Effects of NIK-247 on cholinesterase and scopolamine-induced [amnesia]. NIK-247, [tacrine] and E-2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in human red blood cells (IC50s = 1.0 x 10(-6), 2.9 x 10(-7) and 3.7 x 10(-8) M, respectively). In addition, NIK-247 and [tacrine], but not E-2020, strongly inhibited butyrylcholinestrase (BuChE) in human serum. All compounds at 0.1-1 mg/kg p.o. significantly improved the [amnesia] induced by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in rats performing a passive avoidance task.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients were enrolled on a study of [thalidomide] using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. Patients began [thalidomide] at 400 mg/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg/d by day 54. [Somnolence] and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg/day dose level. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of [thalidomide] in renal cell carcinoma. The dose-response relationship, if any, of [thalidomide] for renal cell carcinoma is unclear.

 Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels during nitric oxide-induced [headache] in patients with chronic tension-type [headache]. It has been proposed that nitric oxide (NO) induced [headache] in primary [headache]s may be associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve (AUCCGRP) on [GTN] vs. placebo day in either patients (P=0.65) or controls (P=0.48). The AUCCGRP recorded on the [GTN] day did not differ between patients and controls (P=0.36). Both in patients and controls, CGRP levels changed significantly over time, on both the [GTN] and placebo days (P < 0.05). The present study indicates that NO-induced immediate [headache] is not associated with release of CGRP.

 Myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm during [dobutamine] stress echocardiography. [Dobutamine] stress echocardiography (DSE) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischemia. The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by [dobutamine]. We performed DSE on 51 patients with [coronary spastic angina] but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram ([variant angina]). DSE was performed with intravenous [dobutamine] infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg/kg/min every 5 minutes.

 Risk for valvular heart disease among users of [fenfluramine] and dex[fenfluramine] who underwent echocardiography before use of medication. BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of [fenfluramine] and dex[fenfluramine] had valvular disease, these drugs were withdrawn from the market. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of [fenfluramine] or dex[fenfluramine] who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications. DESIGN: Cohort study. PATIENTS: 46 patients who used [fenfluramine] or dex[fenfluramine] for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy. The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy, defined as progression of either [aortic or mitral regurgitation] by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U.S. Food and Drug Administration criteria (at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation). The primary outcome was new or worsening valvulopathy, defined as progression of either [aortic or mitral regurgitation] by at least one degree of severity and disease that met U.S. Food and Drug Administration criteria (at least mild [aortic regurgitation] or moderate mitral regurgitation). RESULTS: Two patients (4.3% [95% CI, 0.6% to 14.8%]) receiving [fenfluramine]-phentermine developed valvular heart disease. One had baseline bicuspid aortic valve and mild [aortic regurgitation] that progressed to moderate regurgitation. The second patient developed new moderate [aortic insufficiency].

 BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over [cisplatin] (CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over [cisplatin] ([CDDP]) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to [peripheral nervous system damage]. RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose-dependent [peripheral neurotoxicity]. The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by [CDDP], mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by [CDDP] that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.

 Iatrogenic risks of [endometrial carcinoma] after treatment for breast cancer in a large French case-control study. Since [tamoxifen] is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer, its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined. Cases of [endometrial cancer] diagnosed after breast cancer (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of [tamoxifen] received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for [tamoxifen] users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women who receive [tamoxifen] for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment. A long-term evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of [tamoxifen] as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted.

 BACKGROUND: Increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of [tamoxifen]. Review of the literature reveals an association between [tamoxifen] use and gynecologic tumors. CASE: A 52-year-old postmenopausal woman was treated with [tamoxifen] for stage II estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinoma. Her aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of [tamoxifen] use. After an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases, the patient was found to have a stage Ic [granulosa cell tumor of the ovary]. CONCLUSION: Patients with [tamoxifen]-induced liver dysfunction may be at increased risk for granulosa cell tumors because of alterations in [tamoxifen] metabolism.

 It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with [mitomycin C] treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. The renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of [mitomycin C] treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema. Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic [HUS] and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis.

 [Nephrotoxic] effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography. BACKGROUND: The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in [nephropathy]. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less [nephrotoxic] than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the [iohexol] group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with [iohexol], -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the [[iohexol]] group (P=0.001; the increase with iodixanol minus the increase with [[iohexol]], -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the iodixanol group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the [iohexol] group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodixanol group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving iodixanol had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the [iohexol] group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the [iohexol] group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the [iohexol] group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the iodixanol group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the [[iohexol]] group (P=0.003; value in the iodixanol group minus the value in the [[iohexol]] group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). CONCLUSIONS: [Nephropathy] induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when iodixanol is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.

 [Neuroleptic malignant syndrome] is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia. [Risperidone], a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic, has high serotonin 5-HT2 receptor blockade and dose-related D2 receptor blockade. The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with [risperidone] at low dosages. With this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms, it was thought the frequency of [neuroleptic malignant syndrome] might also be lowered. The syndrome reversed after discontinuing [risperidone] and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine.

 Thus, [caffeine] (3.3 mg/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions. Borderline [hypertensive] men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg. Low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of [hypertension] and had screening BP < 130/85 mm Hg. Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12-hour abstinence from [caffeine] in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits. [Caffeine]-induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004). We suspect that the potential for [caffeine] to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.

[Venlafaxine] is a new antidepressant agent that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. We report a [venlafaxine]-MAOI interaction that resulted in the serotonin syndrome in a 23-y-old male who was taking tranylcypromine for depression. He had been well until the morning of presentation when he took 1/2 tab of [venlafaxine].

A series of agents acting primarily on neurotransmitters other than dopamine were then tested in combination with L-DOPA to see if the [dyskinetic] movements would be modified. Several drugs, including clonidine, physostigmine, methysergide, 5-MDOT, propranolol, and MK-801, markedly reduced the [dyskinetic] movements but at the cost of a return of parkinsonian symptomatology.

 Several structurally related metabolites of progesterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-20-ones) and deoxycorticosterone (3 alpha-hydroxy pregnane-21-diol-20-ones) and their 3 beta-epimers were evaluated for protective activity against [pilocarpine]-, kainic acid- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced seizures in mice. Although the neuroactive steroids were considerably less potent than the benzodiazepine clonazepam in protecting against [pilocarpine] seizures, steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha-configuration had comparable or higher protective index values (TD50 for motor impairment divided by ED50 for seizure protection) than clonazepam, indicating that some neuroactive steroids may have lower relative toxicity. However, when a second dose of the steroid was administered 1 hr after the first dose, complete protection from the kainic acid-induced limbic seizures and [status epilepticus] was obtained.

Steroids with the 3-hydroxy group in the alpha-position and 5-H in the alpha- or beta-configurations were highly effective in protecting against pilocarpine (416 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced limbic motor seizures and [status epilepticus] (ED50 values, 7.0-18.7 mg/kg, i.p.). Steroids with the 5 alpha,3 alpha- or 5 beta,3 alpha-configurations also produced a dose-dependent delay in the onset of limbic seizures induced by [kainic acid] (32 mg/kg, s.c.), but did not completely protect against the seizures.

Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58, [zidovudine] and placebo. Twenty-three patients (38%) and 15 (26%), in the combination and [zidovudine] groups, respectively, discontinued therapy (p = 0.15). The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 4 was 73.8 cells/mm3 and 52.4 cells/mm3 for the combination and [zidovudine] groups, respectively (p > 0.36).

Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor [N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid] ([CB 3717]). [CB 3717], N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid, is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme. [CB 3717], [N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid], is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme. Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of [CB 3717] polyglutamates. Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H][CB 3717], 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as [CB 3717] tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H][[CB 3717]], 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as [[CB 3717]] tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, [CB 3717] di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than [CB 3717], respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of [CB 3717] cytotoxicity. As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, [[CB 3717]] di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than [[CB 3717]], respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of [[CB 3717]] cytotoxicity. In early clinical studies with [CB 3717], activity has been seen in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. Toxicities included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting [nephrotoxicity]. This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of [CB 3717] under acidic conditions. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of [CB 3717] administered with alkaline diuresis is under way. Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest that a reduction in [nephrotoxicity] may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients.

 METHODS: Male Wistar rats (150-200 g; 6 rats per group) were treated with saline or mesna 5 min (i.p.) before and 2 and 6 h after (v.o.) administration of [IFS]. [Cystitis] was evaluated 24 h after its induction by the changes in bladder wet weight and by macroscopic and microscopic analysis. RESULTS: The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of mesna with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by [IFS] by 84.79% and 89.13%, respectively. In addition, it almost abolished the macroscopic and microscopic alterations induced by [IFS]. However, the replacement of last two doses of mesna with saline or all of the mesna doses with dexamethasone did not prevent [HC].

 Behavioral effects of MK-801 on [reserpine]-treated mice. The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by [reserpine] treatments. This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for Parkinson's disease, or [tardive dyskinesia], and its response after glutamatergic blockage. [Reserpine] also produced tremor and catalepsy, which are signs suggestive of Parkinson's disease. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by [reserpine]. However, MK-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in [reserpine]-treated mice. [Reserpine] (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice. On the other hand, [reserpine] induced increases in tremor and catalepsy compared to control mice. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) administration attenuated the catalepsy and tremor induced by [reserpine]. Pretreatment with [reserpine] (1 mg/kg) 24 h before the observation test produced increases in vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusion, as well as increases in tremor and catalepsy, whereas MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) injection 90 min before the test reversed the effects of [reserpine].

 Behavioral effects of MK-801 on [reserpine]-treated mice. The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by [reserpine] treatments. [Reserpine] (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by [reserpine]. [Reserpine] (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice. These results show that [reserpine] produces different and abnormal movements, which are related to dose and schedule employed and can be considered as parkinsonian-like and tardive dsykinesia signs. The glutamatergic blockage produced by NMDA can restore these signs, such as vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions, catalepsy and [tremor] according to the employed model.

 RESULTS: [Prostigmine]-morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi. Glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely normalized the [prostigmine]-morphine-induced alterations in these quantitative parameters (TmaX over the LP: 11.33 +/- 1.13; over the HH: 18.88 +/- 1.48; and over the CBD: 36.22 +/- 1.92; and T1/2 over the LP: 28.21 +/- 1.83; over the HH: 33.42 +/- 3.10; and over the CBD: 41.66 +/- 6.33), suggesting an effective sphincter-relaxing effect of glyceryl trinitrate. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine-induced [sphincter of Oddi spasm] in humans.

Therefore, 60 male rats were randomly assigned to receive daily injection of saline (C), [methylprednisolone] ([[M]]), or triamcinolone (T) 80 mg/kg/d for 5 d. Nutritional intake, measured daily in 15 animals, showed a significant reduction of food intake in the steroid-treated groups (-50 and -79% in [[M]] and T, respectively). [M]aximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +/- 174 g/cm(2)) than in the [M] group (837 +/- 171 g/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the T group (765 +/- 145 g/cm(2), NS). Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups, and time to peak tension was longer with [M], whereas tetanic tensions were similar. ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber [atrophy] in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa [atrophy] with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis. ATPase staining of the diaphragm, scalenus medius, and gastrocnemius showed type IIb fiber [[atrophy]] in the steroid groups and also diaphragmatic type IIa [[atrophy]] with T, whereas histologic examinations revealed a normal muscular pattern with absence of necrosis. Finally, a pair-fed (PF) study, performed in 18 rats (C, T, and PF), showed that [muscle atrophy] was considerably less pronounced in PF animals than in T-treated animals. We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb [atrophy], resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis; (4) type IIb [atrophy] was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.

This was associated with a similar [loss in body weight]. [M]aximal twitches of the diaphragm were lower in the C group (653 +/- 174 g/cm(2)) than in the [M] group (837 +/- 171 g/cm(2); p < 0.05) and the T group (765 +/- 145 g/cm(2), NS). Half-relaxation time was prolonged in both steroid groups, and time to peak tension was longer with [M], whereas tetanic tensions were similar.

We conclude that (1) short-term treatment with massive doses of steroids induced severe respiratory and limb muscle wasting; (2) both types of steroids induced predominantly type IIb [atrophy], resulting in the expected alterations in diaphragm contractile properties; (3) neither steroid caused muscle necrosis; (4) type IIb [atrophy] was not caused by acute nutritional deprivation alone.

A phase I clinical study of the antipurine antifolate [lometrexol] ([DDATHF]) given with oral folic acid. [Lometrexol] is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis. Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that [lometrexol] has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate. However, the initial clinical development of [lometrexol] was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities. Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of [lometrexol] can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of [lometrexol] given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of [lometrexol] can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation.

 We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of [adriamycin] (ADR). We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of [adriamycin] ([ADR]). Rats were stratified into control groups and [ADR]-induced nephropathy groups. RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with [ADR] revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation. They also had significantly higher levels of [proteinuria] compared with control and treatment groups (P < 0.05). Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the [ADR]-nephropathy group (P < 0.05). In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the [ADR]-nephropathy group. However, in the [ADR]-nephropathy group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas. CONCLUSION: We suggest that interactions between NO and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the [ADR]-induced nephrosis.

Additionally, 20 to 25% of [paracetamol]-treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi. A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following [paracetamol] feeding. An electron microscope study of the livers of [paracetamol]-treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcinogens.

 Erythropoietin restores the [anemia]-induced reduction in cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in rat tumors. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of [anemia] prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental tumors. Four days after [carboplatin] treatment, tumors (DS-sarcoma of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. Neither [carboplatin] nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se. In the [anemia] group, the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls (13.3 days versus 8.6 days). In the group where [anemia] was prevented by rHuEPO treatment, growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days). These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced [anemia] reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors, whereas correction of [anemia] by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue.

 Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced [psychosis] during overt continuous verbal fluency. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist [ketamine] leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, [ketamine] exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. [Ketamine]-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and [ketamine] for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. [Ketamine] led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency.

 OBJECTIVE: [Diabetic nephropathy] is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against [diabetic nephropathy]. RESULTS: The glomeruli of human [diabetic nephropathy] patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels. In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating [streptozotocin]-induced renal damage. Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against [diabetic nephropathy] is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production.

 BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative [convulsive] seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative [convulsive] [seizures] from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose [tranexamic acid] (TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose [tranexamic acid] ([TXA]) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative [seizures]. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but [seizures] were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients. All patients with [seizures] did not have permanent neurological abnormalities. No evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their [seizures] was apparent.

 Longitudinal assessment of air conduction audiograms in a phase III clinical trial of difluoromethylornithine and [sulindac] for prevention of sporadic colorectal adenomas. A phase III clinical trial assessed the recurrence of adenomatous polyps after treatment for 36 months with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) plus [sulindac] or matched placebos. Temporary [hearing loss] is a known toxicity of treatment with DFMO, thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms. Based on 290 subjects, there was an average difference of 0.50 dB between subjects treated with DFMO plus [sulindac] compared with those treated with placebo (95% confidence interval, -0.64 to 1.63 dB; P = 0.39), adjusted for baseline values, age, and frequencies. There were 14 of 151 (9.3%) in the DFMO plus [sulindac] group and 4 of 139 (2.9%) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested (P = 0.02). There is a <2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with DFMO plus [sulindac] compared with those treated with placebo.

 At puberty (P40), half the PCPA-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with [testosterone] (T, 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week). At puberty (P40), half the PCPA-treated rats and half the saline-treated rats began treatment with [testosterone] ([T], 5 mg/kg, 5 days/week). Behavioral measures included locomotion, [irritability], copulation, partner preference, and aggression. Behavioral measures included locomotion, [irritability], copulation, partner preference, and [aggression]. Animals were tested for [aggression] in their home cage, both with and without physical provocation (mild tail pinch). Chronic [T] treatment significantly decreased 5-H[T] and 5-HIAA in certain brain areas, but to a much lesser extent than PCPA. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased [irritability] but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or aggression. Chronic exposure to PCPA alone significantly decreased locomotor activity and increased [irritability] but had no effect on sexual behavior, partner preference, or [aggression]. [T]he most striking effect of combining [T]+PCPA was a significant increase in attack frequency as well as a significant decrease in the latency to attack, particularly following physical provocation. Based on these data, it can be speculated that pubertal AAS users with low central 5-HT may be especially prone to exhibit [aggressive behavior].

 Intracavitary chemotherapy ([paclitaxel]/carboplatin liquid crystalline cubic phases) for recurrent glioblastoma -- clinical observations. For human glioblastoma recurrences, the feasibility, safety, and short-term effects of a surgical intracavitary application of [paclitaxel] and carboplatin encapsulated by liquid crystalline cubic phases are examined in a pilot study. A total of 12 patients with a recurrence of a glioblastoma multiforme underwent re-resection and received an intracavitary application of [paclitaxel] and carboplatin cubic phases in different dosages. In the latter group, [brain edema] was markedly reduced and dealt medically.

 Six cases of [cauda equina syndrome] with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993-1997. All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% [lignocaine]. The dose of hyperbaric 5% [lignocaine] administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg. Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% [lignocaine]. The dose of hyperbaric 5% [[lignocaine]] administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg.

 PURPOSE: Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of [ocular hypertension] and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility. Paired eyes were perfused in serum-free media with or without 10(-7) M [dexamethasone] for 12 days. RESULTS: A significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with [dexamethasone] with an average pressure rise of 17.5 +/- 3.8 mm Hg after 12 days of [dexamethasone] exposure.

 Long-term [lithium] treatment and the kidney. This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long-term [lithium] treatment on the kidney. Creatinine clearance, maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long-term [lithium] for more than one year. These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to [lithium], available for most of our patients. No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during [lithium] treatment. Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-[lithium] values. [Polyuria] above 3 litres/24 hours was found in 10% of patients.

 [Suprofen], a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent. Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute [flank pain] syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the United States. To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 [suprofen]-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome.

 The etiology of [pyeloureteritis cystica] has long been attributed to chronic infection and inflammation. The disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of [heparin] therapy for suspected pelvic thrombophlebitis and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinuation.

 Long-term administration of [quinidine] was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of SGOT, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase. Liver biopsy showed active [hepatitis]. Discontinuance of [quinidine] therapy led to normalization of liver function tests. A challenge dose of [quinidine] caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic acid dehydrogenase values. This report also suggests that, even after long-term administration, the [hepatic toxicity] is reversible.

 Cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen, adriamycin, carbon tetrachloride, [chloroform] and galactosamine. In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, cholesteryl hemisuccinate, tris salt (CS) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the [hepatotoxic] effects of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, [chloroform]- and galactosamine-induced toxicity. The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine [hepatotoxicity]).

 Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and [daunorubicin] but not doxorubicin. PURPOSE: The anthracyclines [daunorubicin] and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the [hematologic toxicity] following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, [daunorubicin], and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, [daunorubicin], and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from [daunorubicin] and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of [daunorubicin] activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating [hematologic toxicity].

[Vancomycin] was curative in 95% of 43 patients with proven infection. Drugs were ceased in six patients because of adverse reactions; in three of these [vancomycin] was considered the likely cause. Reactions included thrombophlebitis (20 of 54 patients), rash (4 of 54), nephrotoxicity (4 of 50), [proteinuria] (1 of 50) and ototoxicity (1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry). Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an aminoglycoside plus [vancomycin]. We conclude that [vancomycin], administered appropriately, constitutes safe, effective therapy for infections caused by susceptible bacteria.

 Delayed-onset [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia. BACKGROUND: [Heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. BACKGROUND: [Heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia presents 5 to 12 days after [heparin] exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. Delayed recognition and treatment of [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia contribute to poor patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia are delayed. PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications. MEASUREMENTS: Platelet counts, onset of objectively determined thromboembolism, results of [heparin]-induced platelet factor 4 antibody tests, and outcomes. RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included [heparin] exposure--in most cases, with no thrombocytopenia recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications. Thromboemboli were venous (12 patients, 7 with [pulmonary emboli]) or arterial (4 patients) or both. On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic [heparin], which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 x 10(9) cells/L; mean nadir after [heparin] re-exposure, 39 x 10(9) cells/L). On readmission, 11 patients received therapeutic [[heparin]], which worsened the patients' clinical condition and, in all 11 cases, decreased the platelet count (mean at readmission, 143 x 10(9) cells/L; mean nadir after [[heparin]] re-exposure, 39 x 10(9) cells/L). Results of serologic tests for [heparin]-induced antibodies were positive in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-onset [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia is increasingly being recognized. To avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider [heparin]-induced thrombocytopenia whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with thromboembolism; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not [heparin], should be initiated.

Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed [segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis] without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement. Although cessation of [sulphasalazine] treatment resulted in improvements in fever, red eyes, chest pain, titer of C-reactive protein and volume of the pleural effusions, we initiated steroid therapy, because PR3-ANCA titer rose to 320 EU, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the pleural effusion remained. This case suggests that [sulphasalazine] can induce PR3-ANCA-positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis.

In single dose studies, [DH], MD, and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10. In contrast, [DH] and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and VSD was noted across all dose groups. Variations and malformations were similar when [ASA] was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with [ASA] given at multiple doses.

In patients with [OAB] urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of [OAB] symptoms in female patients. Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate [OAB] symptoms.

 The incidence and severity of [succinylcholine]-associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before [succinylcholine] (n = 32 for each). The incidence and severity of [[succinylcholine]]-associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before [[succinylcholine]] (n = 32 for each). In conclusion, there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of [succinylcholine]-associated myalgia. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between [postoperative myalgia] and time course of interleukin-6 concentrations, a marker of inflammation.

 Postoperative myalgia after [succinylcholine]: no evidence for an inflammatory origin. A common side effect associated with [succinylcholine] is postoperative myalgia. The pathogenesis of this [myalgia] is still unclear; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evidence. We designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this [myalgia]. Incidence and severity of [myalgia] did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of [myalgia] compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe [myalgia] was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant). Incidence and severity of [[myalgia]] did not differ significantly between the two groups: 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of [[myalgia]] compared with 18 patients in the saline group, and severe [[myalgia]] was reported by five patients and three patients, respectively (not significant).

At 48 h after surgery, 12 patients in both groups still suffered from [myalgia] (not significant). We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported [myalgia]; no relationship between [myalgia] and the increase of IL-6 was found. We found an increase of IL-6 for only three patients, but only one patient reported [[myalgia]]; no relationship between [[myalgia]] and the increase of IL-6 was found. IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before [succinylcholine] was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of [succinylcholine]-induced postoperative myalgia. IMPLICATIONS: Administration of dexamethasone before [[succinylcholine]] was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of [[succinylcholine]]-induced postoperative myalgia. Pretreatment with dexamethasone is not justified to prevent postoperative myalgia after [succinylcholine].

 Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti-[amnesic] effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats. Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the [amnesic]-like effects of NMDAR and GABA(A)R ligands. Both PREGS and its (-) enantiomer blocked the effects of [scopolamine]. The results show that, unlike PREGS, 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate and epipregnanolone sulphate failed to block the effect of [scopolamine], suggesting that altering the modulation of NMDA receptors diminishes the memory-enhancing effects of PREGS.

 Effect of [lithium] maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function. OBJECTIVES: To assess changes induced by [lithium] maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid, parathyroid and ion alterations. These were evaluated with respect to the duration of [lithium] therapy, age, sex, and family history (whether or not the patient had a first-degree relative with thyroid disease). PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients (28 men and 73 women) with bipolar disorder receiving [lithium] maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year's to 32 years' duration. OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of calcium, magnesium and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning [lithium] therapy and at biannual follow-up. RESULTS: [Hypothyroidism] developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at baseline. RESULTS: [Hypothyroidism] developed in 40 patients, excluding 8 patients who were [hypothyroid] at baseline. Women over 60 years of age were more often affected by [hypothyroidism] than women under 60 years of age (34.6% versus 31.9%). Magnesium levels in patients on [lithium] treatment were unchanged from baseline levels. After [lithium] treatment, calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels. Thus, [lithium] treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with aging.

 BACKGROUND: [Sirolimus] (formerly rapamycin) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T-cell activation. BACKGROUND: [Sirolimus] (formerly [rapamycin]) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with T-cell activation. Activated peripheral blood T cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone-induced apoptosis than did normal T cells, particularly in the presence of [sirolimus]. Because patients with severe psoriasis may develop [capillary leak] from various systemic therapies, clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with inflammatory diseases who are treated with immune modulators.

MESNA was given orally on the days of treatment with [[IF]] in 3 doses of 840 mg/m2, each administered at 0 hr (= injection of [[IF]]), 4 hr and 8 hr p.i. A further group of 25 patients under polychemotherapy with [IF] were treated by conventional prophylactic measures (raised fluid intake and forced diuresis). In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions (total 24%), but nearly all patients developed either gross haematuria and/or symptoms of [bladder irritation] (cystitis and pollakisuria). Our results support the view that MESNA, given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include [IF], simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium.

 Incomplete [cerebral ischemia] (30 min) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteries. Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of [malondialdehyde], oxypurines, and nucleosides. Plasma [malondialdehyde], which was present in minimal amount at zero time (0.058 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.015), increased after 5 min of ischemia, resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion (0.298 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.078). Increased plasma [malondialdehyde] was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during ischemia, although in this latter group [malondialdehyde] was significantly higher. The present data indicate that the determination of [malondialdehyde], oxypurines, and nucleosides in peripheral blood, may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

In rats given 1% [[BHA]], RA co-administered at a dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.25% showed a dose-dependent enhancing effect on the development of the [[BHA]]-induced epithelial hyperplasia. Tumors, all [papillomas], were induced in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% RA and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% RA co-administration. These findings indicate that RA acted as a co-carcinogen in the [BHA] forestomach carcinogenesis of the rat.

 [Ketanserin] pretreatment reverses alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity. Systemic pretreatment with [ketanserin], a relatively specific type-2 serotonin receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist alfentanil. Intraperitoneal [ketanserin] administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the alfentanil-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Despite the absence of rigidity, animals that received [ketanserin] (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by alfentanil were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone. Rats that received [ketanserin] and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received [ketanserin] alone. Rats that received [[ketanserin]] and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received [[ketanserin]] alone. Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced rigidity, although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, [cardiovascular, and respiratory depression].

 Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, [rigidity] was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. Intraperitoneal [ketanserin] administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the alfentanil-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the [rigidity] produced by alfentanil. Rats that received [ketanserin] and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received [ketanserin] alone. Rats that received [[ketanserin]] and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received [[ketanserin]] alone. These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that [muscle rigidity], a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways. Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced [rigidity], although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.

 Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl-induced [muscular rigidity] in the rat. Whereas [muscular rigidity] is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon, using male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with [ketamine]. Such an induced [muscular rigidity] by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. It is speculated that the induction of [muscular rigidity] by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.

On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose [paracetamol]-induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of [substance abuse] among survivors of acute liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: [Paracetamol]-induced acute liver failure did not affect long-term mortality.

 Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine-induced [psychosis] in a Japanese population. BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for [psychotic disorders] such as schizophrenia. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or [phencyclidine] was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of [psychotic disorders]. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced [psychosis] are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced [psychosis]. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced [psychosis] patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced [psychosis] patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced [psychosis] patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced [psychosis] in the Japanese population.

 Detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin-induced [epileptiform activity] in anesthetized rats. Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for [epilepsy] research. In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced [epileptiform activity] in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. [urethane] and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. After a short period of basal activity recording, [epileptic] focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl penicillin-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced [epileptiform activity] periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the [epileptiform activity] and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and [epileptiform activity]).

 Therapeutic drug monitoring of [tobramycin]: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of [tobramicyn] on steady-state serum concentrations and toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. [tobramycin] (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups. Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of [tobramycin] and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. [Tobramycin] serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of [nephrotoxicity]. CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of [tobramycin] is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen.

 Chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative ([SM-5887]) on normal heart and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs. In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or [SM-5887] (2.5 mg/kg). Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the [SM-5887] administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations. Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or [SM-5887] (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. The low-grade [cardiotoxic] changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment. On the contrary, the [SM-5887] treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy.

 Chronic effects of a novel synthetic [anthracycline] derivative (SM-5887) on normal heart and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs. This study was designed to investigate the chronic [cardiotoxic] potential of SM-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM-5887 on low-grade [cardiotoxic]ity pre-induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs. To examine a possibly deteriorating [cardiotoxic] effect of SM-5887, low-grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg). The low-grade [cardiotoxic] changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment. In conclusion, SM-5887 does not have any potential of chronic [cardiotoxicity] and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin-induced [cardiotoxicity] in dogs.

 Neuropeptide-Y immunoreactivity in the [pilocarpine] model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This expression may represent an endogenous damping mechanism since NPY has been shown to block [seizure]-like events following high-frequency stimulation in hippocampal slices. [PILO]-injected animals exhibited NPY immunoreactivity in the region of the mossy fibre terminals, in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer and, in a few cases, within presumed granule cells. In addition, [PILO] injected animals exhibited a reduction in the number of NPY-immunoreactive interneurons compared with controls. The results demonstrate that changes in NPY expression, including expression in the granule cells and mossy fibres and the loss of vulnerable NPY neurons, are present in the [PILO] model of TLE.

 It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to [coronary occlusion] and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation. During a transient (20-s) [coronary occlusion], a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced. During [dipyridamole]-induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in [dipyridamole]-induced hyperemia. Thallium-201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during [dipyridamole]-induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03).

 Passage of [mannitol] into the brain around gliomas: a potential cause of rebound phenomenon. AIM: Widespread use of [mannitol] to reduce brain edema and lower elevated ICP in brain tumor patients continues to be afflicted by the so-called rebound phenomenon. Leakage of [mannitol] into the brain parenchyma through an altered BBB and secondary reversal of osmotic gradient is considered the major cause of rebound . As a contribution to this issue we decided to research the possible passage of [mannitol] into the brain after administration to 21 brain tumor patients. METHODS: [Mannitol] (18% solution; 1 g/kg) was administered as a bolus to patients (ten had malignant glioma, seven brain metastases and four meningioma) about 30 minutes before craniotomy. During resection, a sample of the surrounding [edematous] white matter was taken at the same time as a 10 ml venous blood sample. [Mannitol] concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most glioma patients, mannitol concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). [Mannitol] concentrations were measured in plasma and white matter by a modified version of the enzyme assay of Blonquist et al. RESULTS: In most glioma patients, [mannitol] concentrations in white matter were 2 to 6 times higher than in plasma (mean 3.5 times). In meningioma and metastases patients plasma concentrations of [mannitol] were higher than white matter concentrations except in three cases with infiltration by neoplastic cells.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that, in lifetime captopril-treated spontaneously [[hypertensive]] rats (SHR), the sympathetic nervous system contributes importantly to the [[hypertensive]] effect of dietary sodium chloride supplementation. METHODS: Male SHR (aged 6 weeks) that had been treated from conception onward with either captopril or vehicle remained on a basal [sodium chloride] diet or were fed a high [sodium chloride] diet. METHODS: Male SHR (aged 6 weeks) that had been treated from conception onward with either captopril or vehicle remained on a basal [[sodium chloride]] diet or were fed a high [[sodium chloride]] diet. Intravenous infusion of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium resulted in a rapid decline in MAP that eliminated the dietary sodium chloride-induced [increase in MAP] in both groups. Infusion of the central nervous system alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine also resulted in a greater reduction in MAP in both groups of SHR that were fed the high (compared with the basal) [sodium chloride] diet. CONCLUSIONS: In both lifetime captopril-treated and control SHR, the sympathetic nervous system contributes to the pressor effects of a high [sodium chloride] diet.

 Predictors of decreased renal function in patients with heart failure during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy: results from the studies of [left ventricular dysfunction] (SOLVD) BACKGROUND: Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), it may also cause decreased renal function. METHOD: We analyzed data from the Studies of [Left Ventricular Dysfunction] (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, [diuretic], and beta-blocker therapy. By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, [diuretic] therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. [Diuretic] therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of decreased renal function in the enalapril group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66).

[creatinine-decreased renal function]
 Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum [creatinine] >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and [diabetes] were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with [diabetes]. [Diabetes] was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group.

 Predictors of decreased renal function in patients with heart failure during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy: results from the studies of [left ventricular dysfunction] (SOLVD) BACKGROUND: Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), it may also cause decreased renal function. There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to [enalapril] with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to [enalapril] had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls (P =.003). By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and [enalapril] groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective.

 Experiments in vitro showed that acetylcholine-induced [catecholamine] release from bovine adrenal medulla is depressed as much as 50% by 0.3 mM NH4Ac and KCl-induced contractions of guinea-pig ileum were inhibited 20% by 5 mM NH4Ac. Addition of excess calcium reversed the depression in both tissues, but calcium-independent [catecholamine] release by acetaldehyde was not blocked by NH4Ac. Both verapamil (10 mg/kg i.p.) and NH4Ac pretreatment enhanced morphine [analgesia]- and diazepam-induced muscular incoordination and antagonized amphetamine-induced motor activity, and neither verapamil nor NH4Ac affected the convulsant action of metrazol.

This prospective study determined the incidence of [CIN] for two nonionic contrast media (CM), iopromide and iohexol, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of CM and the presence of cyanosis. Serum [sodium] (Na), potassium (K), and creatinine (Cr) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values, then measured again at 12-, 24-, and 48-h intervals after CM use. Serum [sodium] ([Na]), potassium (K), and creatinine (Cr) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values, then measured again at 12-, 24-, and 48-h intervals after CM use.

Accordingly, among the 15 [CIN] patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had renal injury. Whereas 33.3% of the patients with [CIN] were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of [CIN] related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014).

Among the 15 patients with [CIN], 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243). Although clinically silent, [CIN] is not rare in pediatrics. The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although [CIN] usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.

The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide (group A, n = 40) or [iohexol] (group B, n = 40). Risk of renal failure, [Injury to the kidney], Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage renal damage (RIFLE criteria) were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population. Accordingly, among the 15 CIN patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had [renal injury], whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had [renal injury]. Accordingly, among the 15 CIN patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had [[renal injury]], whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had [[renal injury]].

[iohexol-Injury to the kidney]
 The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide (group A, n = 40) or [iohexol] (group B, n = 40). The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of [cyanosis], and although CIN usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.

 There have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular [thrombotic] events may be higher with cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We evaluated cardiovascular event data for [valdecoxib], a new COX-2-specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical trials. The rates of events in users of aspirin were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across [valdecoxib] doses.

 Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol-induced [catalepsy]. Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory [amino acid] microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility. Haloperidol-induced [catalepsy] was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl).

In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced [catalepsy] in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice.

 Metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of [Parkinson's disease]. Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of [Parkinson's disease] (PD). Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of [Parkinson's disease] ([PD]). Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of [PD] is not known. The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of [PD]. Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses [haloperidol]-induced catalepsy in rats.

 [Nimodipine] prevents memory impairment caused by nitroglycerin-induced hypotension in adult mice. BACKGROUND: Hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of [cognitive dysfunction]. We tested the hypothesis that [nimodipine] (NIMO) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory. We tested the hypothesis that [nimodipine] ([NIMO]) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) NTG immediately after learning, 3) NTG 3 h after learning, 4) NTG and [NIMO], 5) vehicle, and 6) [NIMO] alone. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) NTG immediately after learning, 3) NTG 3 h after learning, 4) NTG and [[NIMO]], 5) vehicle, and 6) [[NIMO]] alone. Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, NTG + [NIMO], or delayed NTG (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively). In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of NTG (n = 3) and NTG + [NIMO] (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with [NIMO] alone decreased from 88.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg to 80.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg. PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the NTG group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the NTG + [NIMO] groups, respectively. [NIMO] attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by NTG but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension. The observed effect of [NIMO] may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension, because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups.

The extent of [hypotension] and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals. In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of NTG (n = 3) and NTG + [NIMO] (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively.

CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of NTG immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced [hypotension] had no effect.

This cardioprotection is accompanied by decreased cardiac oxidative stress and [triglycerides] and increased cardiac fatty-acid oxidation, ATP synthesis, and upregulated JAK/STAT3 pathway. In the current study, we investigated whether a physiological intervention by feeding 40% high fat diet (HFD), which induces obesity in male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g), sensitizes to doxorubicin-induced [cardiotoxicity].

These results indicate that daidzein might play a role in acetylcholine biosynthesis as a ChAT activator, and that it also ameliorates [scopolamine]-induced amnesia.

 CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of [pharyngitis]. Few cases of drug-induced hiccups have been reported related to [macrolide] antimicrobials. Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other [macrolides] and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups. However, [macrolide] antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side-effect.

 In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule [nitric oxide] (NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule [nitric oxide] ([NO]) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura. In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the [headache] response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura. [Headache] was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008).

 The time course and concentration-effect relationship of terbutaline-induced [hypokalemia] was studied, using computer-aided pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling. Six healthy subjects were given a 0.5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions: 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg [oxprenolol] orally. [Oxprenolol] caused decreases of 65% and 56% of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance, respectively, and an increase of 130% of its AUC.

Subsequently we investigated the efficacy of oxprenolol in antagonizing such [hypokalemia], together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both drugs. In the 7-hour period after terbutaline administration, plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma [potassium] levels and drug concentrations. The sigmoid Emax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and [potassium] effects. In spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after oxprenolol pretreatment, the [hypokalemia] was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2-blocking action.

 Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in [hypotensive] effect of methyldopa. Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a [hypotensive] response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord. Further, [5,7-DHT] lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection. It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa-induced [hypotension] via descending projections, the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.

 Reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by [tacrolimus] in a pediatric heart transplant recipient: case report. [Tacrolimus] is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by [tacrolimus] after heart transplantation. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial [edema] and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood [tacrolimus] concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, [tacrolimus] dosage was reduced. The blood [[tacrolimus]] concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, [[tacrolimus]] dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of [tacrolimus] and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy. Thus, we conclude that [tacrolimus] induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy. In patients receiving [tacrolimus] therapy, blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement.

We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of [N-methyl-d-aspartate] ([NMDA]) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats. Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced [spastic paraparesis]. IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after morphine-induced [spastic paraparesis] compared with the saline group. We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via [NMDA] receptor activation.

[N-methyl-D-aspartate-spastic paraparesis]
 The activation of spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of [spinal cord ischemia]. [Spinal cord ischemia] was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter. After IT morphine, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [glutamate] concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C (P < 0.05). These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF [glutamate], which is involved in NMDA receptor activation. We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of [spinal cord ischemia] via NMDA receptor activation.

 [Sodium] channel beta-subunits modulate channel gating, assembly, and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems. We generated beta2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of [sodium] channel density, localization, and function in neurons in vivo. Measurements of [(3)H]saxitoxin (STX) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane [sodium] channels in beta2(-/-) neurons. The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in [sodium] current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane [sodium] channels. In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of [Na](v)1.6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to [seizures], as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced [seizures], but seemed normal in other neurological tests. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to [[seizures]], as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced [[seizures]], but seemed normal in other neurological tests.

The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or [parkinsonian] 'off' signs. Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in [parkinsonism], the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID. We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate [parkinsonism] and dyskinesias, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy.

METHODS: [Puromycin aminonucleoside] ([PAN]) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria. RESULTS: Following intravenous [PAN] urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four.

 The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction, during estrogen [carcinogenesis], are still unknown. The results demonstrated that [17beta-estradiol] (E2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The results demonstrated that [17beta-estradiol] ([E2]) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the [E2] exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. After 15 days of [E2] exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of [E2] exposure.

 Receptor mechanisms of nicotine-induced [locomotor hyperactivity] in chronic nicotine-treated rats. In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated [dopamine] (DA) level in the striatum. In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated [dopamine] ([DA]) level in the striatum. However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and the striatal [DA] level were normal.

 Receptor mechanisms of nicotine-induced [locomotor hyperactivity] in chronic nicotine-treated rats. At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of L-[3H]nicotine and [3H][spiperone] binding sites in the striatum. We observed no changes in nicotine-induced locomotor response, striatal L-[3H]nicotine and [3H][spiperone] binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day. The number of striatal [3H][spiperone] binding sites was not affected. However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H][spiperone] binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal. These results suggest that chronic nicotine-treated rats develop [locomotor hyperactivity] in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and DA concentration, followed by inducing DA receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.

Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial [oxygen] consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial [oxygen] consumption. Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial [[oxygen]] consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial [[oxygen]] consumption.

 Prolongation of the QT interval related to cisapride-[diltiazem] interaction. Cisapride, a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrate, is widely prescribed for the treatment of [gastrointestinal motility disorders]. A possible drug interaction occurred in a 45-year-old woman who was taking cisapride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and [diltiazem], an agent that has inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, for hypertension. We suggest that caution be taken when cisapride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, including [diltiazem].

 CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of [amisulpride] 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg. Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of [pheochromocytoma]. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of [pheochromocytoma] are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and [amisulpride] and tiapride therapy. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of tiapride and [amisulpride].

[nicardipine-Pheochromocytoma]
 [Pheochromocytoma] unmasked by amisulpride and tiapride. OBJECTIVE: To describe the unmasking of [pheochromocytoma] in a patient treated with amisulpride and tiapride. CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and tiapride 100 mg. Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and [verapamil] treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of [pheochromocytoma]. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of [pheochromocytoma] are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: As of March 24, 2005, this is the first reported case of amisulpride- and tiapride-induced hypertensive crisis in a patient with [pheochromocytoma].

 CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old white man developed acute hypertension with severe headache and vomiting 2 hours after the first doses of amisulpride 100 mg and [tiapride] 100 mg. Both drugs were immediately discontinued, and the patient recovered after subsequent nicardipine and verapamil treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed an adrenal mass, and postoperative histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of [pheochromocytoma]. DISCUSSION: Drug-induced symptoms of [pheochromocytoma] are often associated with the use of substituted benzamide drugs, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In our case, use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a possible relationship between the hypertensive crisis and amisulpride and [tiapride] therapy. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should be aware of this potential adverse effect of [tiapride] and amisulpride.

 To examine the relationship between quantitative stimulant drug levels, catecholamines, and psychotic symptoms, nineteen patients in a psychiatric emergency service with a diagnosis of [amphetamine]- or cocaine-induced psychosis were interviewed, and plasma and urine were collected for quantitative assays of stimulant drug and catecholamine metabolite levels. Meth[amphetamine] or [amphetamine] levels were related to several psychopathology scores and the global hyperkinesia rating. Although many other factors such as sensitization may play a role, intensity of stimulant-induced psychotic symptoms and [stereotypies] appears to be at least in part dose-related.

 Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and [cidofovir]. The use of [cidofovir] in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. Two patients developed adenovirus [hemorrhagic cystitis] after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous [cidofovir] for progressive disseminated disease. RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus [hemorrhagic cystitis] and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. Use of [cidofovir] in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia.

[cidofovir-hemorrhagic cystitis]
 Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe [adenovirus disease] in immunocompromised children. The incidence of severe [adenovirus disease] in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe [adenovirus disease], nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe [adenovirus disease] is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and [cidofovir]. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe [adenovirus disease] in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe [adenovirus disease]. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous [cidofovir] for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed [adenovirus pneumonia]; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with [adenovirus pneumonia]. The remaining 3 children died of [adenovirus disease]. Use of [cidofovir] in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia. DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe [adenovirus disease], namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe [adenovirus disease] in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated [adenovirus disease] may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe [adenovirus disease] treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of [adenovirus infection] possible. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of [adenovirus disease] in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.

Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of [adenovirus disease] in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.

 Catalepsy induced by combinations of [ketamine] and morphine: potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat. Previous studies demonstrated that both [ketamine] and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat. Pre-treatment with [ketamine] produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to [ketamine] but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain. Pre-treatment with [[ketamine]] produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to [[ketamine]] but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain. The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of [ketamine] and morphine, administered simultaneously. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of [ketamine] and morphine, but sub-effective doses of [ketamine] partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of [[ketamine]] and morphine, but sub-effective doses of [[ketamine]] partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine. The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of [ketamine] and morphine were similar. Rats, tolerant to [ketamine]-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to morphine-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to [ketamine]. Rats, tolerant to [[ketamine]]-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to morphine-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to [[ketamine]]. While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy, differences in latency, [rigidity] and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site.

The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and [ribavirin].

[ribavirin-infected with hepatitis C virus]
 [Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus] (HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and [ribavirin]. Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of [ribavirin]-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. Although [ribavirin]-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage [ribavirin]-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages.

CONCLUSION: [Milk-alkali syndrome] may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons. CONCLUSION: [Milk-alkali syndrome] may be a common cause of unexplained [hypercalcemia] and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons. Treatment with hydration, furosemide, and discontinuation of the [calcium] and vitamin D source is adequate. Pamidronate treatment is associated with considerable risk for hypocalcemia, even in cases of initially severe [hypercalcemia].

 Management strategies for [ribavirin]-induced hemolytic anemia in the treatment of hepatitis C: clinical and economic implications. Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: [ribavirin]-induced hemolytic anemia (RIHA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of [CHC] in a clinical trial setting. The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the [ribavirin] dosage. Questions remain about the optimal dose of [ribavirin] and the incidence of RIHA in a real-world population.

 Effects of amine pretreatment on ketamine [catatonia] in pinealectomized or hypophysectomized animals. The present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal idolamines on ketamine-induced [catatonia] in the intact, pinealectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat. In the pinealectomized chick, pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of [catatonia] (DOC) after ketamine, but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not. Serotonin and [N-acetyl serotonin] which augmented ketamine DOC, did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland, whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine DOC in both the intact and pinealectomized chick. Furthermore, dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine [catatonia] rather than directly on the pituitary.

The effect was attenuated by both the NK1 receptor selective antagonist RP 67,580 and the NK2 receptor selective antagonist [SR 48,968], given intra-arterially, suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both NK1 and NK2 receptors. The effect of intra-arterial PGE2 could not be blocked by intra-arterial RP 67,580 or [SR 48,968], which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra-arterial PGE2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the PG was given intravesically.

 Metformin prevents experimental [gentamicin]-induced nephropathy by a mitochondria-dependent pathway. The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent [vascular dysfunction] even in nondiabetic patients. Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of [gentamicin] toxicity. Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive oxygen species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after [gentamicin] administration. Metformin treatment fully blocked [gentamicin]-mediated acute renal failure. Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after [gentamicin] administration. We found that [gentamicin] treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen [gentamicin] nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.

Those patients receiving AmB and spironolactone required significantly less [potassium] supplementation to maintain their plasma [potassium] within the normal range (P = 0.022). Those patients receiving AmB and spironolactone required significantly less [[potassium]] supplementation to maintain their plasma [[potassium]] within the normal range (P = 0.022). Moreover, urinary [potassium] losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and spironolactone than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.040).

[potassium-hypokalemia]
 [Spironolactone]: is it a novel drug for the prevention of amphotericin B-related hypokalemia in cancer patients? OBJECTIVE: [Nephrotoxicity] is the major adverse effect of amphotericin B (AmB), often limiting administration of full dosage. Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB. Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of AmB. This study was designed to assess the ability of [spironolactone] to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment. METHODS: In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral [spironolactone] 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection. RESULTS: Patients receiving concomitant AmB and [spironolactone] had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.0027). Those patients receiving AmB and [spironolactone] required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range (P = 0.022). Moreover, urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and [spironolactone] than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.040). CONCLUSION: This study showed that [spironolactone] can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment.

 Treatment of [risperidone]-induced hyperprolactinemia with a dopamine agonist in children. BACKGROUND: [Risperidone], a potent antagonist of both serotonergic (5HT2A) and dopaminergic D2 receptors is associated with hyperprolactinemia in adults and children. Chronically elevated prolactin levels in children with [prolactinomas] may be associated with arrested growth and development resulting in either delayed puberty or short stature. We report the successful treatment of [risperidone]-induced hyperprolactinemia with cabergoline in youth. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of four children with [risperidone]-induced hyperprolactinemia treated with cabergoline. RESULTS: Four males (age 6-11 years) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition) bipolar disorder or psychoses, with [risperidone]-induced elevations in serum prolactin levels (57.5-129 ng/mL, normal 5-15 ng/mL), were treated with cabergoline (mean dose 2.13 +/- 0.09 mg/week). The mean duration of therapy with cabergoline was 523.5 +/- 129.7 days, and the mean duration of therapy with [risperidone] was 788.5 +/- 162.5 days. CONCLUSIONS: Cabergoline may be useful for the treatment of [risperidone]-induced hyperprolactinemia in youth; however, further research is needed.

 Effects of [cisapride] on symptoms and postcibal small-bowel motor function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome is a common cause of abdominal pain and discomfort and may be related to [disordered gastrointestinal motility]. Our aim was to assess the effects of long-term treatment with a prokinetic agent, [cisapride], on postprandial jejunal motility and symptoms in the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with IBS (constipation-predominant, n = 17; diarrhoea-predominant, n = 21) underwent 24-h ambulatory jejunal manometry before and after 12 week's treatment [[cisapride], 5 mg three times daily (n = 19) or placebo (n = 19)]. RESULTS: In diarrhoea-predominant patients significant differences in contraction characteristics were observed between the [cisapride] and placebo groups.

In [[[[cisapride]]]]-treated diarrhoea-predominant patients the mean contraction amplitude was higher (29.3 +/- 3.2 versus 24.9 +/- 2.6 mm Hg, [[[[cisapride]]]] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 25.7 +/- 6.0 mm Hg), the mean contraction duration longer (3.4 +/- 0.2 versus 3.0 +/- 0.2 sec, [[[[cisapride]]]] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 3.1 +/- 0.5 sec), and the mean contraction frequency lower (2.0 +/- 0.2 versus 2.5 +/- 0.4 cont./min, [[[[cisapride]]]] versus placebo (P < 0.001); pretreatment, 2.5 +/- 1.1 cont./min] than patients treated with placebo. Symptom scores relating to the severity of constipation were lower in [cisapride]-treated constipation-predominant IBS patients [score, 54 +/- 5 versus 67 +/- 14 mm, [cisapride] versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 62 +/- 19 mm]. Symptom scores relating to the severity of constipation were lower in [[cisapride]]-treated constipation-predominant IBS patients [score, 54 +/- 5 versus 67 +/- 14 mm, [[cisapride]] versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 62 +/- 19 mm]. Diarrhoea-predominant IBS patients had a higher pain score after [cisapride] therapy [score, 55 +/- 15 versus 34 +/- 12 mm, [cisapride] versus placebo (P < 0.05); pretreatment, 67 +/- 19 mm].

 Late [cardiotoxicity] after treatment for a malignant bone tumor. Cardiac function was assessed in long-term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to Rosen's T5 or T10 protocol, both including [doxorubicin]. Cumulative doses of [doxorubicin] were 225-550 mg/m2 (median dose 360). Eighteen of 31 (58%) patients showed [cardiac toxicity], defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities: late potentials, complex ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular dilation, decreased shortening fraction, or decreased ejection fraction. No correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of [doxorubicin] and cardiac status, except for heart rate variability.

 [Nephrotoxic] effects of aminoglycoside treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation. To quantify the effects of gentamicin, kanamycin and [netilmicin] on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation, these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg/day) for 7, 14 or 21 days. Kanamycin and [netilmicin] appeared to have no effect at the dose used. While gentamicin and kanamycin decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme [netilmicin] had no effect. Thus, aminoglycosides may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and/or tubular level inducing [impairment of renal reabsorption] and accumulation of proteins.

 Acute renal toxicity of [doxorubicin] (adriamycin)-loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Acute renal toxicity of [doxorubicin] ([adriamycin])-loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Acute [doxorubicin]-loaded nanoparticle (DXNP) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis. In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free [doxorubicin] (DX) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived. In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free [doxorubicin] ([DX]) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or [DX]NP survived. A 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with [DX]NP than in those treated with [DX]. Two hr post-injection, [DX]NP was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free [DX] (p < 0.025). In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis, 5/6 rats given [DX] died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by [DX]NP, NP, or untreated, which all survived. Proteinuria appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after [doxorubicin] treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between DXNP and DX. Proteinuria appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after [doxorubicin] treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between [DX]NP and [DX]. These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, [DX]NP killed less animals than free [DX], despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former. Both effects (better survival and [nephrosis]) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.

 Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of [ketamine]. Effect of [ketamine] on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery. This [depression] was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase. Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the [ketamine]-induced tachycardia, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery. This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of [ketamine] injected in the SA node artery.

 Long-term efficacy and toxicity of high-dose [amiodarone] therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. [Amiodarone] was administered to 154 patients who had sustained, symptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 118) or a cardiac arrest (n = 36) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Sixty-nine percent of patients continued treatment with [amiodarone] and had no recurrence of symptomatic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) over a follow-up of 6 to 52 months (mean +/- standard deviation 14.2 +/- 8.2). Six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of VT and were successfully managed by continuing [amiodarone] at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic drug. Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of [amiodarone] in 41% and discontinuation of [amiodarone] in 10% of patients. Adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of [[amiodarone]] in 41% and discontinuation of [[amiodarone]] in 10% of patients. The most common symptomatic adverse reactions were [tremor] or ataxia (35%), nausea and anorexia (8%), visual halos or blurring (6%), thyroid function abnormalities (6%) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates (5%). Although large-dose [amiodarone] is highly effective in the long-term treatment of VT or VF refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs, it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50% of patients. However, when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects, 75% of patients with VT or VF can be successfully managed with [amiodarone].

These findings do not support a role for [calcium] channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension.

[calcium-ventricular arrhythmias]
 Effect of [calcium chloride] and 4-aminopyridine therapy on desipramine toxicity in rats. BACKGROUND: Hypotension is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant [overdose]. METHODS: Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker [overdose]. [CaCl2] and 4-aminopyridine. Fifteen min later, animals received [CaCl2], NaHCO3, or saline. [CaCl2] and 4-aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (p = 0.004) and seizures (p = 0.03) in the [CaCl2] group was higher than the other groups. CONCLUSION: The administration of [CaCl2] or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension in rats. [CaCl2] therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity.

 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-one assessable patients, 2 to 12 years of age, were treated with oral [cis-RA] administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period, for up to 12 courses. RESULTS: The MTD of [cis-RA] was 160 mg/m2/d. All toxicities resolved after [cis-RA] was discontinued. The DLT correlated with serum levels > or = 10 mumol/L. CONCLUSION: The MTD of [cis-RA] given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg/m2/d. Serum levels known to be effective against [neuroblastoma] in vitro were achieved at this dose. The DLT included hypercalcemia, and may be predicted by serum [cis-RA] levels. Monitoring of serum calcium and [cis-RA] levels is indicated in future trials.

Moreover, M(3)-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist [4-DAMP] ([4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine-methiodide]) partially abolished the beneficial effects of pilocarpine. These data suggest that pilocarpine produced anti[arrhythmic] actions on [arrhythmic] rat and guinea pig models induced by aconitine or ouabain via stimulating the cardiac M(3)-mAChR. The mechanism may be related to the improvement of Ca(2+) handling.

 Myocardial infarction in pregnancy associated with [clomiphene citrate] for ovulation induction: a case report. BACKGROUND: [Clomiphene citrate] (CC) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction. BACKGROUND: [Clomiphene citrate] ([CC]) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction. Thromboembolism is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with [CC]. CASE: A 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received [CC] for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain. At the time of admission, the patient was at high risk of [radiation injury] to the fetus, so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester. CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between [CC] and myocardial infarction. Thrombosis might be a rare but hazardous complication of [CC].

 Hepatonecrosis and cholangitis related to long-term [phenobarbital] therapy: an autopsy report of two patients. [Phenobarbital] (PB) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that PB-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. [Phenobarbital] ([PB]) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that [PB]-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. [Phenobarbital] ([[PB]]) has a reputation for safety, and it is commonly believed that [[PB]]-related increases in serum aminotransferase levels do not indicate or predict the development of significant chronic liver disease. Here we report of two adult patients with a long history of epilepsy treated with [PB] who died suddenly: one as consequence of cardiac arrest, the other of acute bronchopneumonia. At autopsy, analysis of liver parenchyma revealed rich portal inflammatory infiltrate, which consisted of mixed eosinophil and monocyte cells, associated with several foci of [necrosis] surrounded by a hard ring of non-specific granulomatous tissue. Our findings illustrate that [PB] may be associated with chronic liver damage, which may lead to more serious and deleterious consequences. For this reason, each clinician should recognize this entity in the differential diagnosis of [PB]-related asymptomatic chronic hepatic enzyme dysfunction.

 [Ethambutol]-associated optic neuropathy. INTRODUCTION: [Ethambutol] is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent visual loss. We report 3 cases which presented with [bitemporal hemianopia]. CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with [ethambutol]-associated toxic optic neuropathy are described. TREATMENT: Despite stopping [ethambutol] on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months. CONCLUSIONS: [Ethambutol] usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up. The author postulates that in cases of [ethambutol] associated chiasmopathy, [ethambutol] may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm.

 Effects of verapamil on [atrial fibrillation] and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs. BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of [atrial fibrillation] (AF) and decreases L-type Ca(2+) current. BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of [atrial fibrillation] ([AF]) and decreases L-type Ca(2+) current. There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type Ca(2) channel blockade can promote [AF], consistent with an [AF] promoting effect of Ca(2+) channel inhibition. There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type Ca(2) channel blockade can promote [[AF]], consistent with an [[AF]] promoting effect of Ca(2+) channel inhibition. METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of [AF] promotion by Ca(2+) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine-chloralose anesthetized dogs. Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and [nadolol] was applied in some experiments. Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during [AF]. RESULTS: Verapamil caused [AF] promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of [AF] induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. RESULTS: Verapamil caused [[AF]] promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of [[AF]] induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. In these experiments, verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of [AF] (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005). Diltiazem did not affect ERP, [AF] cycle length or [AF] duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil (n=5). Diltiazem did not affect ERP, [[AF]] cycle length or [[AF]] duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil (n=5). In the presence of autonomic blockade, verapamil failed to promote [AF] and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted [AF] by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil promotes [AF] in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem.

 Influence of diet free of NAD-precursors on acetaminophen [hepatotoxicity] in mice. The present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of NAD, the substrate on which PARP acts, in female NMRI mice with AAP [hepatitis] and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these animals. [Liver injuries] were quantified as serum activities of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT). While AAP caused a 117-fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet, which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by [nicotinic acid amide] (NAA), adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of NAD.

 Impact of [alcohol] exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measures. BACKGROUND: More than 3 decades after Jones and Smith (1973) reported on the devastation caused by [alcohol] exposure on fetal development, the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively unchanged. Early identification of fetal [alcohol] exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcomes. This study examined the utility of biometry for detecting [alcohol]-related fetal growth impairment. METHODS: We obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief [alcohol] intervention study. Because intensity of [alcohol] consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy (average of >or=5 drinks per drinking day) [alcohol] consumers. Because intensity of [[alcohol]] consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes, separate analyses were conducted for the heavy (average of >or=5 drinks per drinking day) [[alcohol]] consumers. Analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and [drug abuse]. When women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies, fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non-[alcohol]-exposed group, regardless of prior drinking patterns. Any [alcohol] consumption postpregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were nondrinkers. Although the reliance on self-reported drinking is a limitation in this study, these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal [alcohol] effects.

OBJECTIVES: To study the urinary symptoms and quality of life changes in Thai women with overactive bladder (OAB) after [tolterodine] treatment. [Tolterodine] 2 mg, twice daily was given. The number of [nocturia] episodes decreased from 5.4 +/- 4.2 to 1.1 +/- 1.0 times per night. CONCLUSION: [Tolterodine] was well tolerated and its effects improved the quality of life in Thai women with OAB.

 The authors describe the unusual association between diffuse B-cell gastric lymphoma and myotonic dystrophy, the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy, and sudden atrial fibrillation following one cycle of [doxorubicin]-based chemotherapy in the same patient. The [cardiac toxicity] intrinsically associated with the aggressive chemotherapy employed could function as a triggering factor for the arrhythmia in the predisposed myocardium of this patient.

 A phase II study of [thalidomide] in advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients were enrolled on a study of [thalidomide] using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. Patients began [thalidomide] at 400 mg/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg/d by day 54. Somnolence and constipation were prominent [toxicities] and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg/day dose level. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of [thalidomide] in renal cell carcinoma. The dose-response relationship, if any, of [thalidomide] for renal cell carcinoma is unclear.

 A phase II study of [thalidomide] in advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the toxicity and activity of [thalidomide] in patients with advanced metastatic renal cell cancer and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165, with therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients were enrolled on a study of [thalidomide] using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. Patients began [thalidomide] at 400 mg/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg/d by day 54. RESULTS: 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary [metastases] (4%), one minor response, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of [thalidomide] in renal cell carcinoma. The dose-response relationship, if any, of [thalidomide] for renal cell carcinoma is unclear.

 It has been proposed that nitric oxide (NO) induced headache in [primary headaches] may be associated with release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during headache induced by the NO donor [glyceryl trinitrate] (GTN) in 16 patients with chronic tension-type headache and 16 healthy controls. In the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of CGRP during headache induced by the NO donor [glyceryl trinitrate] ([GTN]) in 16 patients with chronic tension-type headache and 16 healthy controls. The subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 microg/kg/min [GTN] or placebo over 20 min on two headache-free days. Both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate headache on the [GTN] day than on the placebo day and the headache was significantly more pronounced in patients than in controls. There was no difference between the area under the CGRP curve (AUCCGRP) on [GTN] vs. placebo day in either patients (P=0.65) or controls (P=0.48). The AUCCGRP recorded on the [GTN] day did not differ between patients and controls (P=0.36).

 Nitric oxide synthase expression in the course of lead-induced [hypertension]. We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites (NOx), and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead-induced [hypertension]. This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead-induced [hypertension] is, in part, due to depressed NO synthase (NOS) expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead-treated group (given lead acetate, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given lead and [vitamin E]-fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or [vitamin E]-fortified food for 12 weeks.

[Vitamin E] supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma MDA, or NOS expression in the control group. In conclusion, lead-induced [hypertension] in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression. This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated NO inactivation, lead-associated inhibition of NOS activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with [hypertension].

This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated NO inactivation, lead-associated inhibition of NOS activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with [hypertension].

 BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over [cisplatin] (CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over [cisplatin] ([CDDP]) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. [Pain] perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high-dose treatment. The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by [CDDP], mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by [CDDP] that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism.

 Iatrogenic risks of endometrial carcinoma after treatment for [breast cancer] in a large French case-control study. Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after [breast cancer] (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of [breast cancer] and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after [[breast cancer]] (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of [[breast cancer]] and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Women who had received [tamoxifen] were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of [tamoxifen] received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for [tamoxifen] users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women who had endometrial cancer and had received [tamoxifen] had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment. Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with [breast cancer]. Endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with [tamoxifen] have poorer prognosis.

 [Mitomycin C] associated hemolytic uremic syndrome. [Mitomycin C] associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with [mitomycin C] treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. The renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of [mitomycin C] treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema. Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin [thrombi], expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis.

[Mitomycin C-thrombi]
 [Mitomycin C] associated hemolytic uremic syndrome. [Mitomycin C] associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with [mitomycin C] treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. The renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of [mitomycin C] treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema. Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, [ischemic] wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis. The mechanism of action is postulated as [mitomycin C]-induced endothelial cell damage. We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with [mitomycin C] and died in pulmonary edema.

A 2-wk administration of LiCl (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mPGES-1 +/+ mice led to a marked [polyuria] with hyposmotic urine. In contrast, mPGES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to lithium-induced [polyuria] and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE(2) and cAMP output. Similarly, the total protein abundance of the [Na]-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the +/+ mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment.

 Does supplemental [vitamin C] increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes? BACKGROUND: [Vitamin C] acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro. These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of [vitamin C] in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between [vitamin C] intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease.

From day 0 to day 3, the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per deciliter in the [[iodixanol]] group and 0.55 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.001; the increase with [[iodixanol]] minus the increase with iohexol, -0.42 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.73 to -0.22]). Two of the 64 patients in the [iodixanol] group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the [iodixanol] group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). Two of the 64 patients in the [[iodixanol]] group (3 percent) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the iohexol group (26 percent) (P=0.002; odds ratio for such an increase in the [[iodixanol]] group, 0.09 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.41]). No patient receiving [iodixanol] had an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, but 10 patients in the iohexol group (15 percent) did. The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the [iodixanol] group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.003; value in the [iodixanol] group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). The mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per deciliter in the [[iodixanol]] group and 0.24 mg per deciliter in the iohexol group (P=0.003; value in the [[iodixanol]] group minus the value in the iohexol group, -0.17 mg per deciliter [95 percent confidence interval, -0.34 to -0.07]). CONCLUSIONS: Nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high-risk patients when [iodixanol] is used rather than a low-osmolar, nonionic contrast medium.

 [Nephrotoxic] effects in high-risk patients undergoing angiography. BACKGROUND: The use of iodinated contrast medium can result in [nephropathy]. Whether iso-osmolar contrast medium is less [nephrotoxic] than low-osmolar contrast medium in high-risk patients is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, prospective, multicenter study comparing the [nephrotoxic] effects of an iso-osmolar, dimeric, nonionic contrast medium, iodixanol, with those of a low-osmolar, nonionic, monomeric contrast medium, iohexol. The study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum [creatinine] concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per deciliter who underwent coronary or aortofemoral angiography. The primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the [creatinine] concentration during the three days after angiography. Other end points were an increase in the [creatinine] concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the [creatinine] concentration from day 0 to day 7. Other end points were an increase in the [[creatinine]] concentration of 0.5 mg per deciliter or more, an increase of 1.0 mg per deciliter or more, and a change in the [[creatinine]] concentration from day 0 to day 7.

 Experimental cranial pain elicited by [capsaicin]: a PET study.

A small amount of [capsaicin] was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned [migraine] study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state.

Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, nitrous oxide, [oxygen], and isoflurane. [Hypotension] was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg. GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during [hypotension]. Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when [hypotension] was induced, allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow. We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane-induced [hypotension] and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.

METHODS: Male Wistar rats (150-200 g; 6 rats per group) were treated with saline or [mesna] 5 min (i.p.) before and 2 and 6 h after (v.o.) administration of IFS. One, two or three doses of [mesna] were replaced with dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone plus [mesna]. One, two or three doses of [[mesna]] were replaced with dexamethasone alone or with dexamethasone plus [[mesna]]. RESULTS: The replacement of the last dose or the last two doses of [mesna] with dexamethasone reduced the increase in bladder wet weight induced by IFS by 84.79% and 89.13%, respectively. Moreover, the addition of dexamethasone to the last two doses of [mesna] was more efficient than three doses of [mesna] alone when evaluated microscopically. Moreover, the addition of dexamethasone to the last two doses of [[mesna]] was more efficient than three doses of [[mesna]] alone when evaluated microscopically.

 Behavioral effects of MK-801 on [reserpine]-treated mice. The effects of dizocilpine (MK-801), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, were studied on dopamine-related behaviors induced by [reserpine] treatments. This study focuses on behavioral syndromes that may used as models for [Parkinson's disease], or tardive dyskinesia, and its response after glutamatergic blockage. [Reserpine] (1 mg/kg), administered once every other day for 4 days, produced increases in orofacial dyskinesia, tongue protrusion and vacuous chewing in mice, which are signs indicative of tardive dyskinesia. MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the observation test, prevented the vacuous chewing movements, tongue protrusions and catalepsy induced by [reserpine]. However, MK-801 injection produced a significant increase of tremor in [reserpine]-treated mice. [Reserpine] (1 mg/kg), administered 90 min before the test and followed by apomophine injection (0.1 mg/kg) 5 min before the test, did not produce oral dyskinesia in mice.

Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of [lometrexol] can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of [lometrexol] given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of [lometrexol] can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of [[lometrexol]] given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of [[lometrexol]] can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation. Associated studies demonstrated that [lometrexol] plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing [lometrexol] plasma clearance.

Carteolol, as well as propranolol and biperiden, inhibited the haloperidol-induced [catalepsy].

Therefore, the effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and [biperiden], a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Carteolol, as well as propranolol and [biperiden], inhibited the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol, but was weaker than that of [biperiden]. These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol-induced catalepsy via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of [akathisia] without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity.

 Effects of [UMB24] and (+/-)-SM 21, putative sigma2-preferring antagonists, on behavioral toxic and stimulant effects of cocaine in mice. Earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma1 receptors attenuates the [convulsive], lethal, locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of cocaine in mice. To begin addressing this need, we characterized [UMB24] (1-(2-phenethyl)-4-(2-pyridyl)-piperazine) and (+/-)-SM 21 (3alpha-tropanyl-2-(4-chorophenoxy)butyrate) in receptor binding and behavioral studies. To begin addressing this need, we characterized [UMB24] ([1-(2-phenethyl)-4-(2-pyridyl)-piperazine]) and (+/-)-SM 21 (3alpha-tropanyl-2-(4-chorophenoxy)butyrate) in receptor binding and behavioral studies. Receptor binding studies confirmed that [UMB24] and (+/-)-SM 21 display preferential affinity for sigma2 over sigma1 receptors. When administered alone, (+/-)-SM 21 produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline, but [UMB24] had locomotor depressant actions.

 Preservation of renal blood flow during [hypotension] induced with fenoldopam in dogs. The introduction of drugs that could induce [hypotension] with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy. The hypothesis that fenoldopam could be used to induce [hypotension] and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested.

 BACKGROUND: [Pain] on injection of propofol is unpleasant. METHODS: A total of 128 patients undergoing general surgery were randomly allocated to receive normal saline (control) or [remifentanil] to a target Ce of 2 ng ml(-1) (R2), 4 ng ml(-1) (R4), or 6 ng ml(-1) (R6) administered via TCI. RESULTS: The incidence of [pain] was significantly lower in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (12/32 and 6/31 vs 26/31 and 25/32, respectively, P<0.001). [Pain] was less severe in Groups R4 and R6 than in the control and R2 groups (P<0.001). However, both incidence and severity of [pain] were not different between Groups R4 and R6.

 Prenatal exposure to fluoxetine induces [fetal pulmonary hypertension] in the rat. RATIONALE: Fluoxetine is a selective [serotonin] reuptake inhibitor antidepressant widely used by pregnant women. Epidemiological data suggest that fluoxetine exposure prenatally increases the prevalence of persistent [pulmonary hypertension syndrome] of the newborn. The mechanism responsible for this effect is unclear and paradoxical, considering the current evidence of a [pulmonary hypertension] protective fluoxetine effect in adult rodents. As compared with controls, fluoxetine exposure resulted in [fetal pulmonary hypertension] as evidenced by an increase in the weight ratio of the right ventricle to the left ventricle plus septum (P = 0.02) and by an increase in pulmonary arterial medial thickness (P < 0.01). In vitro, fluoxetine induced pulmonary arterial muscle contraction in fetal, but not adult, animals (P < 0.01) and reduced [serotonin]-induced contraction at both ages (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the adult, fluoxetine exposure in utero induces [pulmonary hypertension] in the fetal rat as a result of a developmentally regulated increase in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle proliferation.

 [Anemia] was induced using a single dose of carboplatin (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration. In a second group, the development of [anemia] was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before carboplatin application. When tumors were treated with a single dose of [cyclophosphamide] (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed. In the [anemia] group, the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls (13.3 days versus 8.6 days). In the group where [anemia] was prevented by rHuEPO treatment, growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days).

 Erythropoietin restores the anemia-induced reduction in [cyclophosphamide] cytotoxicity in rat tumors. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the cytotoxicity of [cyclophosphamide] in solid experimental tumors. Four days after carboplatin treatment, tumors (DS-[sarcoma] of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. When tumors were treated with a single dose of [cyclophosphamide] (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed. These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of [cyclophosphamide] in tumors, whereas correction of anemia by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue.

 Cyclosporin A (CsA; 50 mg/kg) and Fujimycine (FK506; 5 mg/kg), but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant [rapamycin] (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days. The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 [toxicity] were investigated. In the kidney, high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506, but not by [rapamycin]. Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506, but not [rapamycin].

Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506, but not [rapamycin]. These results suggest that the [nephrotoxic] effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.

The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of [phenobarbital] ([PB]: 15 mg per rat of ingested dose) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine (DEN: 10 mg/kg/day). Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + [PB] during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis. The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + [PB] treated rats. When the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of [PB] did not change significantly the last parameters. In DEN + [PB] treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone. It is concluded that [PB], which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN. This 'anti-carcinogen' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the [precancerous lesions]. Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this 'paradoxical' [PB] effect.

[Ketamine]-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). [Ketamine] elicited psychosis like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and [ketamine] for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. [Ketamine] led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency.

 The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin-induced [diabetic nephropathy]. OBJECTIVE: [Diabetic nephropathy] is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

RESULTS: The glomeruli of human [diabetic nephropathy] patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels. Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against [diabetic nephropathy] is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production. In human renal mesangial cells, high [glucose] induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes.

The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between [TXA] usage and seizures after cardiac surgery. All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of [TXA] intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures. No evidence of [brain ischemic], metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their seizures was apparent. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high-dose [TXA] in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients.

 The dyskinetic [parkinsonian] patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non-dyskinetic [parkinsonian] patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi- and contralateral primary motor areas. The dyskinetic [[parkinsonian]] patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non-dyskinetic [[parkinsonian]] patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi- and contralateral primary motor areas. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like [L-dopa]-induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.

 Dexamethasone-induced [ocular hypertension] in perfusion-cultured human eyes. PURPOSE: Glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of [ocular hypertension] and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facility. In contrast, the dexamethasone-treated [hypertensive eyes] had thickened trabecular beams, decreased intertrabecular spaces, thickened juxtacanalicular tissue, activated trabecular meshwork cells, and increased amounts of amorphogranular extracellular material, especially in the juxtacanalicular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of Schlemm. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone treatment of isolated, perfusion-cultured human eyes led to the generation of [ocular hypertension] in approximately 30% of the dexamethasone-treated eyes. [Steroid] treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and open angle glaucoma.

Paired eyes were perfused in serum-free media with or without 10(-7) M [dexamethasone] for 12 days.

RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of [dexrazoxane] reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, [dexrazoxane] neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of [[dexrazoxane]] reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, [[dexrazoxane]] neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that [dexrazoxane] reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of [dexrazoxane]. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining [dexrazoxane] and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity.

 Reduced cardiotoxicity and preserved antitumor efficacy of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin and [cyclophosphamide] compared with conventional doxorubicin and [cyclophosphamide] in a randomized, multicenter trial of metastatic breast cancer. Reduced cardiotoxicity and preserved antitumor efficacy of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin and [[cyclophosphamide]] compared with conventional doxorubicin and [[cyclophosphamide]] in a randomized, multicenter trial of metastatic breast cancer. PURPOSE: To determine whether Myocet (liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin; The Liposome Company, Elan Corporation, Princeton, NJ) in combination with [cyclophosphamide] significantly reduces doxorubicin cardiotoxicity while providing comparable antitumor efficacy in first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-seven patients with MBC and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were randomized to receive either 60 mg/m(2) of Myocet (M) or conventional doxorubicin (A), in combination with 600 mg/m(2) of [cyclophosphamide] (C), every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Anti[tumor] efficacy was assessed by objective [tumor] response rates (World Health Organization criteria), time to progression, and survival. CONCLUSION: Myocet improves the therapeutic index of doxorubicin by significantly reducing cardiotoxicity and grade 4 neutropenia and provides comparable antitumor efficacy, when used in combination with [cyclophosphamide] as first-line therapy for MBC.

 Protective effect of a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist, [BN 52021], on bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular impairments in rats. Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist [BN 52021] (10 mg/kg), 30 min before bupivacaine administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR. In contrast, doses of 1 mg/kg [BN 52021] given 30 min before or 10 mg/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of bupivacaine were ineffective. When [BN 52021] (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after bupivacaine (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective. A partial recovery of bupivacaine-induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with [BN 52021]. Since the administration of [BN 52021], at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of [BN 52021], a specific antagonist of PAF, against bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity.

Thus, consistent with its direct effect on heart, PAF appears to be implicated in bupivacaine-induced [cardiovascular alterations].

 [Benzylacyclouridine] reverses azidothymidine-induced marrow suppression without impairment of anti-human immunodeficiency virus activity. This agent inhibits Urd catabolism and, in vivo, increases the plasma concentration of Urd in a dose-dependent manner, without Urd-related [toxicity]. In mice rendered anemic and leukopenic by the administration of AZT for 28 days in drinking water (1.5 mg/mL), the continued administration of AZT plus daily [BAU] (300 mg/kg, orally) partially reversed AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia (P less than .05), increased peripheral reticulocytes (to 4.9%, P less than .01), increased cellularity in the marrow, and improved megaloblastosis. When coadministered with AZT from the onset of drug administration, [BAU] reduced AZT-induced marrow toxicity. In vitro, at a concentration of 100 mumol/L, [BAU] possesses minimal anti-HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of AZT to reverse the HIV-induced cytopathic effect in MT4 cells.

 Cyclophosphamide-induced [cystitis] in freely-moving conscious rats: behavioral approach to a new model of visceral pain. i.p. and of 20 mg. by the intravesical route, and [acrolein] at doses of 0.5 mg. by the intravesical route and of 5 mg./kg. Administered at the dose of 20 mg. intravesically, CP did not produce any behavioral effects, whereas [acrolein] at 0.5 mg. intravesically induced behavioral modifications identical to those under CP 200 mg./kg. Conversely, [acrolein] 5 mg./kg. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results indicate that this experimental model of CP-induced [cystitis] may be an interesting new behavioral model of inflammatory visceral pain, allowing a better understanding of these painful syndromes and thus a better therapeutic approach to them.

[[E]todolac] ([E]), is a non-narcotic analgesic and antiinflammatory drug. A biodegradable polymer dextran has been utilized as a carrier for synthesis of [etodolac]-dextran conjugates (ED) to improve its aqueous solubility and reduce gastrointestinal side effects. An activated moiety, i.e. N-acylimidazole derivative of [etodolac] (EAI), was condensed with the polysaccharide polymer dextran of different molecular weights (40000, 60000, 110000 and 200000). [Etodolac] contents were evaluated by UV-spectrophotometric analysis. At pH 9, a higher rate of [etodolac] release from ED was observed as compared to aqueous buffer of pH 7.4 and 80% human plasma (pH 7.4), following first-order kinetics. Acute analgesic and antiinflammatory activities were ascertained using acetic acid induced [writhing] model (mice) and carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model, respectively. In comparison to control, [E] and [E]D1-[E]D4 showed highly significant analgesic and antiinflammatory activities (p <0.001).

 Delayed-onset heparin-induced [thrombocytopenia]. BACKGROUND: Heparin-induced [thrombocytopenia] presents 5 to 12 days after heparin exposure, with or without arterial or venous thromboemboli. Delayed recognition and treatment of heparin-induced [thrombocytopenia] contribute to poor patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe and increase awareness of a clinical scenario in which the onset or manifestations of heparin-induced [thrombocytopenia] are delayed. PATIENTS: 14 patients seen over a 3-year period in whom heparin-induced [thrombocytopenia] became apparent on delayed presentation with thromboembolic complications. RESULTS: Patients went home after hospitalizations that had included heparin exposure--in most cases, with no [thrombocytopenia] recognized--only to return to the hospital (median, day 14) with thromboembolic complications. Subsequent treatments included alternative anticoagulants (11 patients), thrombolytic drugs (3 patients), inferior vena cava filters (3 patients) and, eventually, [warfarin] (11 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Delayed-onset heparin-induced [thrombocytopenia] is increasingly being recognized. To avoid disastrous outcomes, physicians must consider heparin-induced [thrombocytopenia] whenever a recently hospitalized patient returns with thromboembolism; therapy with alternative anticoagulants, not heparin, should be initiated.

There are no published [ASA] studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17. Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when [ASA] is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with [ASA] when a multiple dosing paradigm is used.

METHODS: [ASA] was administered as a single dose on GD 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats. In single dose studies, DH, [MD], and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10. In contrast, DH and [MD] were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and VSD was noted across all dose groups. Variations and malformations were similar when [ASA] was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with [ASA] given at multiple doses.

RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and midline defects (MDs) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia (DH), MDs, and VSDs in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations, even though [ASA] induces several other low-incidence malformations. CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and [hydrocephalus] in the Wistar rats. Variations and malformations were similar when [ASA] was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with [ASA] given at multiple doses.

 PURPOSE: NGF and [PGs] in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups included 65 women with [OAB] and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls. RESULTS: Urinary NGF, PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with [OAB] compared with controls (p <0.05). However, urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with [OAB]. In patients with [OAB] urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). Urinary NGF, PGF2alpha and PGI2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with [OAB]. Urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate [OAB] symptoms.

 The mechanism by which this endogenous [steroid] enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and GABAergic systems. Moreover, PREGS is able to reverse the [amnesic]-like effects of NMDAR and GABA(A)R ligands. The memory-enhancing effects of PREGS and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine-induced [amnesia]. Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine-induced [amnesia]. These results identify a novel neuropharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuroactive [steroids].

 Steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti-[amnesic] effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rats. This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and a negative modulator of [gamma-aminobutyric acid](A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs). This hypothesis stems from findings that PREGS is a potent positive modulator of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and a negative modulator of [gamma-aminobutyric acid](A) receptors ([GABA](A)Rs). To investigate this hypothesis, the present study in rats examined the memory-altering abilities of structural analogs of PREGS, which differ in their modulation of NMDAR and/or [GABA](A)R function. The analogs tested were: 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate (an agent that is inactive at [GABA](A)Rs and NMDARs), epipregnanolone ([3beta-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one] sulphate, an inhibitor of both [GABA](A)Rs and NMDARs), and a newly synthesized (-) PREGS enantiomer (which is identical to PREGS in effects on [GABA](A)Rs and NMDARs). The analogs tested were: 11-ketopregnenolone sulphate (an agent that is inactive at [[GABA]](A)Rs and NMDARs), epipregnanolone ([3beta-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one] sulphate, an inhibitor of both [[GABA]](A)Rs and NMDARs), and a newly synthesized (-) PREGS enantiomer (which is identical to PREGS in effects on [[GABA]](A)Rs and NMDARs).

Moreover, enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural PREGS to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine-induced [amnesia].

 BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of [acute and chronic pain] in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation. The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and [capsaicin]-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity. METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal [capsaicin] injection were determined. RESULTS: Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal [capsaicin] injection for at least 24 h. In contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h). CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral [capsaicin] injection.

 Effect of [lithium] maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function. OBJECTIVES: To assess changes induced by [lithium] maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid, parathyroid and ion alterations. These were evaluated with respect to the duration of [lithium] therapy, age, sex, and family history (whether or not the patient had a first-degree relative with thyroid disease). PATIENTS: One hundred and one patients (28 men and 73 women) with bipolar disorder receiving [lithium] maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year's to 32 years' duration. The control group consisted of 82 patients with no [psychiatric] or endocrinological diagnoses from the hospital's out-patient clinics. OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory analyses of calcium, magnesium and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning [lithium] therapy and at biannual follow-up. All patients having first-degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism (3.7 years after onset of [lithium] therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of [lithium] therapy). All patients having first-degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism (3.7 years after onset of [[lithium]] therapy) compared with patients without a family history (8.6 years after onset of [[lithium]] therapy). Magnesium levels in patients on [lithium] treatment were unchanged from baseline levels. After [lithium] treatment, calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control levels. Thus, [lithium] treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with aging. CONCLUSIONS: Familial thyroid illness is a risk factor for hypothyroidism and hypercalcemia during [lithium] therapy.

 Contribution of the glycine site of [NMDA] receptors in rostral and intermediate-caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rats. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the glycine site of [NMDA] receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone. [Muscle rigidity] was induced by haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7-DCKA), a selective glycine site antagonist, injected in doses of 2.5 and 4.5 microg/0.5 microl bilaterally, into the rostral region of the striatum, decreased both the haloperidol-induced [muscle rigidity] (MMG) and the enhanced electromyographic activity (EMG). The present results suggest that blockade of the glycine site of [NMDA] receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the antiparkinsonian action of this drug.

Treatment of ifosfamide-induced urothelial toxicity by oral administration of [sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate] ([MESNA]) to patients with inoperable lung cancer. The protective effect of oral administration of the thiol compound [sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate] (MESNA) against urothelial toxicity induced by ifosfamide (IF) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable lung cancer under treatment with IF (2250 mg/m2 on days 2-5) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4-week cycle. The protective effect of oral administration of the thiol compound [sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulphonate] ([MESNA]) against urothelial toxicity induced by ifosfamide (IF) was tested in a group of 45 patients with inoperable lung cancer under treatment with IF (2250 mg/m2 on days 2-5) as part of a polychemotherapy regimen repeated in a 4-week cycle. [MESNA] was given orally on the days of treatment with IF in 3 doses of 840 mg/m2, each administered at 0 hr (= injection of IF), 4 hr and 8 hr p.i. In this group of 45 patients under protection with [MESNA] there were 5 complete remissions and 9 partial remissions (total 31%). In this group there were 1 complete and 5 partial remissions (total 24%), but nearly all patients developed either gross haematuria and/or symptoms of bladder irritation ([cystitis] and pollakisuria). There were no appreciable differences between the [MESNA] series and the conventional prophylaxis series with respect to either haematological or systemic toxicity of the cytostatic treatment. Our results support the view that [MESNA], given orally in conjunction with combined cytostatic regimens which include IF, simplifies the treatment and provides optimum protection for the urinary epithelium. Protection with oral [MESNA] is particularly suitable for outpatients.

[idazoxan-muscle flaccidity]
 Dexmedetomidine, acting through central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, prevents opiate-induced [muscle rigidity] in the rat. Intense generalized [muscle rigidity] is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists. Although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced [rigidity] has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism. In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with D-MED prevents the [muscle rigidity] caused by high-dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat. Animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) L-MED (the inactive L-isomer of medetomidine), 30 micrograms/kg; 2) D-MED, 10 micrograms/kg; 3) D-MED, 30 micrograms/kg; 4) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, [idazoxan] [10 mg/kg]; 5) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist DG-5128 [10 mg/kg], or; 6) saline.

 Dynamic response of blood vessel in [acute renal failure]. In this study we postulated that during [acute renal failure] induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels. The beneficial effects of [vitamin C] administration to gentamicin-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium.

 The hemodynamics of [oxytocin] and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery: findings in six cases. [Oxytocin] is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension, particularly when given as a bolus. Parturients with normal volume status, heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and [stroke] volume. [Oxytocin]-induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss.

A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of [Parkinson's disease] ([PD]) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985. Laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant [PD], which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community. According to the literature pallidotomy improves the "on" symptoms of [PD], such as dyskinesias, as well as the "off" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on-off fluctuations. Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving [levodopa]-induced dyskinesias.

Because of the National Acute [Spinal Cord Injury] Studies (NASCIS), high-dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute [spinal cord injury]. In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute [corticosteroid] myopathy that high-dose methylprednisolone may cause. We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of [spinal cord injury] patients. Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the [spinal cord injury]. To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by NASCIS may cause acute [corticosteroid] myopathy.

 This study assessed the effect of normal aging on (1) the [tropicamide]-induced increase in pupil diameter, and (2) the reversal of this effect with pilocarpine. In 1 session, [tropicamide] (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to one eye and placebo to the other. In another session, [tropicamide] (20 microL, 0.01%) was administered to both eyes, followed 23 minutes later by the application of pilocarpine (20 microL, 0.1%) to one eye and placebo to the other. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between elderly and young volunteers in pupillary response to [tropicamide] at any time point (p > 0.05). Compared with the young group, the elderly group had greater scopolamine-induced [impairment in word recall] 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is an age-related pupillary response to pilocarpine that is not found with [tropicamide].

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of [[Ro15-1788]] and a placebo in reversing diazepam-induced effects after surgery under epidural block, and to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of [[Ro15-1788]]. Antagonism of diazepam-induced effects by [Ro15-1788] was investigated postoperatively in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The patient's subjective assessment of mood rating, an objective test of performance, a test for [amnesia], and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min after administration of the trial drug. No significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating, [amnesia], or vital signs. The [Ro15-1788] group showed a significant improvement in the performance test up to 120 min after administration of the drug.
